Watch tuna auctions at dawn, eat fresh sushi and sashimi at counter seats, sample seasonal fruits (Japanese strawberries in spring are extraordinary), and experience authentic Japanese market culture. Unlike Tokyo's Tsukiji (now relocated), Kuromon remains a working market serving locals, not just tourists. Essex County tip: Arrive before 10am for best selection and authentic atmosphere before tour groups.',
