## Technical SEO Requirements

### Page Load Optimization

#### Critical Rendering Path

```html
<!-- Inline critical CSS -->
<style>
  /* Above-fold styles only */
  .hero { ... }
  .neighborhood-overview { ... }
</style>

<!-- Defer non-critical CSS -->
<link rel="preload" href="/styles/neighborhood.css" as="style" onload="this.rel='stylesheet'" />
```

#### Image Optimization

```typescript
// Lazy load deck plans
const DeckPlan = dynamic(() => import('./DeckPlan'), {
  loading: () => <div className="deck-plan-skeleton" />,
  ssr: false
});

// Responsive images with Next.js Image
<Image
  src={`/images/neighborhoods/${neighborhoodSlug}-hero.jpg`}
  alt={`${shipName} ${neighborhoodName} area`}
  width={1200}
  height={630}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 1200px"
  priority={true} // For hero image only
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={blurDataUrl}
/>
```

### Core Web Vitals Targets

#### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

- Target: < 2.5 seconds
- Strategy:
  - Preload hero image
  - Optimize server response time
  - Use CDN for images

#### Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

- Target: < 200ms
- Strategy:
  - Debounce interactive elements
  - Use React.memo for components
  - Implement virtual scrolling for long lists

#### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

- Target: < 0.1
- Strategy:
  - Reserve space for images
  - Avoid dynamic content injection
  - Use CSS aspect-ratio

### Mobile Optimization

```css
/* Mobile-first responsive design */
.neighborhood-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  gap: 1rem;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .neighborhood-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .neighborhood-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
}
```
