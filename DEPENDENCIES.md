## Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

### Critical Path Dependencies

These must be completed first as everything depends on them:

1. **Project Structure** → Everything
   - Blocks: All development
   - Why: Need organized codebase to work in
   - Duration: 2 hours

2. **TypeScript Configuration** → All TypeScript code
   - Blocks: Component development, testing
   - Why: Type safety needed throughout
   - Duration: 1 hour

3. **ESLint/Prettier** → All code quality
   - Blocks: Git hooks, CI/CD
   - Why: Ensures consistent code
   - Duration: 1 hour

### Can Be Parallel

These can be worked on simultaneously:

- **Testing Infrastructure** (Independent)
- **Environment Configuration** (Independent)
- **Error Boundaries** (After React setup)
- **Logging System** (Independent)

### Dependencies Within Phase 1

```

## Risk Areas

### High-Risk Dependencies

Tasks that block many others if delayed:

1. **Project Structure** - Blocks everything
2. **Component Architecture** - Blocks all UI
3. **State Management** - Blocks features
4. **Testing Infrastructure** - Blocks quality assurance
5. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Blocks deployment

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Start High-Risk Tasks First**
   - Complete critical path items before nice-to-haves

2. **Parallel Work Where Possible**
   - Have team members work on independent tasks

3. **Create Temporary Solutions**
   - Mock APIs while waiting for backend
   - Use placeholder components while building real ones

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Deploy basic version first
   - Add features incrementally

## Tracking Dependencies

### Before Starting Any Task, Check:

1. **Prerequisites Met?**
   - Are all dependencies completed?
   - Are blocking tasks done?

2. **Will This Block Others?**
   - Who is waiting for this?
   - What's the impact of delay?

3. **Can It Be Parallel?**
   - Can someone else work on something while this is done?
   - Are there independent tasks available?

### Daily Standup Questions

1. What dependencies am I waiting on?
2. What am I blocking for others?
3. Can we parallelize any work?
4. Are we on the critical path?

---

## Dependency Status Tracking

### Use These Labels

- 🟢 **No Dependencies** - Can start anytime
- 🟡 **Soft Dependencies** - Better to wait but not required
- 🔴 **Hard Dependencies** - Must wait for prerequisite
- ⏸️ **Blocked** - Waiting on dependency
- ▶️ **Unblocked** - Ready to start
- ✅ **Complete** - No longer blocking others

---

## Notes

- Update this document as dependencies change
- Communicate blocks immediately
- Look for opportunities to parallelize
- Consider creating mocks to unblock work
- Regular dependency review in standups

**Remember: The critical path determines your minimum timeline. Optimize it!**
