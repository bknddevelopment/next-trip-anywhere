# Google Business Profile Setup Guide

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes (your action needed)
**Impact:** Appear in Google Maps, local search results, and map pack
**Priority:** CRITICAL for local SEO

---

## Why Google Business Profile Matters

### Current Problem

- ‚ùå Invisible in Google Maps searches
- ‚ùå Not appearing in local "map pack" (top 3 results)
- ‚ùå Competitors with worse websites rank higher locally
- ‚ùå 46% of Google searches are local (you're missing this traffic)

### After GBP Setup

- ‚úÖ Appear in map pack for "travel agency essex county nj"
- ‚úÖ Show up in Google Maps with reviews, hours, photos
- ‚úÖ Display phone number, website, and directions
- ‚úÖ Collect and display customer reviews (social proof)
- ‚úÖ Track calls, website clicks, direction requests

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Business Model (Important Decision)

You mentioned wanting to be **global** (not just Essex County). Here are your options:

### Option A: Service Area Business (Recommended for You)

**Best for:** Nationwide/multi-state travel agencies without physical storefront

**Setup:**

- No physical address shown to customers
- Define service areas (states, cities, or radius)
- Can operate from home office
- Customers come to you (online/phone)

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ Global positioning maintained
- ‚úÖ Can serve entire US
- ‚úÖ No address displayed publicly
- ‚úÖ Still appears in local searches

**Cons:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lower map pack visibility vs storefront businesses
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't rank for hyper-local "near me" searches as well

**Example Service Areas:**

```
New Jersey (entire state)
New York (entire state)
Pennsylvania (entire state)
Connecticut (entire state)
```

OR specific to Essex County:

```
Newark, NJ
East Orange, NJ
Montclair, NJ
Bloomfield, NJ
... (all 22 Essex County municipalities)
```

---

### Option B: Physical Location Business

**Best for:** Travel agencies with a physical storefront

**Setup:**

- Display exact address
- Customers can visit your office
- Show hours of operation
- Enable in-person appointments

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ Maximum map pack visibility
- ‚úÖ "Near me" search rankings
- ‚úÖ Trust signal (physical location)
- ‚úÖ Can verify with postcard

**Cons:**

- ‚ùå Address shown publicly (privacy concern)
- ‚ùå Requires physical location
- ‚ùå More local focus (less global)

---

### Option C: Hybrid (Service Area + Optional Address)

**Best for:** Agencies with office but primarily serve remotely

**Setup:**

- Have physical address but hide it
- Define service areas
- Customers primarily book online/phone
- Can visit by appointment only

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ Best of both worlds
- ‚úÖ Global positioning
- ‚úÖ Strong local presence
- ‚úÖ Address verification easier

**Cons:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires physical address (even if hidden)

## GBP vs Website Schema Alignment

### Current Website Schema Issues

**Problem 1: Service Area Mismatch**

```typescript
// Current in app/layout.tsx
address: {
  '@type': 'PostalAddress',
  addressCountry: 'US',
  addressRegion: 'Nationwide Service', // ‚ùå Too vague
}
```

**Fix After GBP Setup:**

```typescript
address: {
  '@type': 'PostalAddress',
  streetAddress: '123 Main St', // If physical location
  addressLocality: 'Newark',
  addressRegion: 'NJ',
  postalCode: '07102',
  addressCountry: 'US',
}
// OR for service area business:
areaServed: [
  { '@type': 'State', name: 'New Jersey' },
  { '@type': 'State', name: 'New York' },
  // ... additional states
]
```

**Problem 2: Reviews Removed**

```typescript
// Currently commented out (correct - no fake reviews)
// aggregateRating: { ... }
```

**Fix After Real Reviews:**

```typescript
aggregateRating: {
  '@type': 'AggregateRating',
  ratingValue: '4.9', // Actual GBP rating
  reviewCount: '27',  // Actual GBP review count
  bestRating: '5',
  worstRating: '1',
}
```
