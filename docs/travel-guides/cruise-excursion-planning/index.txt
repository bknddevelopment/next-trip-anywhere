Ship excursions offer significant advantages: guaranteed return to ship (they'll wait or fly you to the next port if tours run late), vetted operators meeting safety standards, organized logistics with transportation included, guides speaking English, and refunds for cancelled ports. However, these conveniences cost 40-100% more than identical independent tours. Cruise lines mark up local operator prices substantially, knowing many passengers prioritize convenience and security. Independent excursions through companies like Viator, GetYourGuide, or local operators offer the same experiences at lower prices. That $150 per person Mayan ruins tour from the ship might cost $60 through local operators. Small group sizes provide intimate experiences versus ship tours with 50+ participants. However, you bear all risks: if your tour runs late, the ship leaves without you. Travel insurance rarely covers missed departures from non-ship excursions. Research operators thoroughly, checking recent reviews and safety records. Ensure operators have proper licensing and insurance. Build buffer time - return to ship at least 60-90 minutes before all-aboard time. Consider hybrid approaches for optimal value and security. Book complex excursions requiring extensive logistics through the ship (diving, adventure sports, remote destinations). Arrange simple activities independently (beaches, shopping, city tours). This strategy balances cost savings with risk management, particularly important for Essex County families traveling with children or elderly relatives.","position":1},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Researching and Planning Port Activities","text":"Successful excursion planning begins months before your cruise. Start with comprehensive port research understanding each destination's highlights, logistics, and safety considerations. Cruise Critic forums provide invaluable real-world experiences from recent visitors. YouTube port guides show exactly what to expect. Facebook cruise groups share current pricing and recommendations. Create port priority lists ranking must-see attractions versus nice-to-have options. Popular ports like Cozumel or Nassau offer overwhelming choices requiring focus. Understand your interests: history buffs might prioritize ruins while families may prefer beaches. Consider physical requirements - many Essex County seniors underestimate Caribbean heat and excursion activity levels. Determine port logistics early. Some ports dock directly downtown (Key West, Bermuda) making independent exploration easy. Others require tender boats to shore or dock in industrial areas far from attractions (Belize, Grand Cayman), favoring organized tours. Research transportation options: reliable taxis, public transit, or ship shuttles. Understand local currency, tipping customs, and language barriers. Book popular excursions early, whether through ships or independently. Swimming with dolphins, exclusive beach clubs, and small-group tours sell out months ahead. However, some excursions offer last-minute discounts for unsold spots - check the night before in port. Weather significantly impacts excursions. Have backup plans for rain, rough seas, or excessive heat. Beach days need alternatives when weather disappoints. Museums and shopping provide weather-independent options.","position":2},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Caribbean Port Strategies","text":"Caribbean ports from Cape Liberty cruises each offer unique opportunities and challenges. Cozumel, Mexico's cruise capital, excels for diving and beach clubs. Mr. Sancho's Beach Club ($60 per person) includes food, drinks, and facilities - cheaper than ship beach excursions. Taxis to Playa Palancar cost $15 each way for gorgeous public beaches. Chankanaab Park offers snorkeling, dolphins, and cultural shows independently for half ship prices. Jamaica (Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, Falmouth) requires more caution. Aggressive vendors and safety concerns make ship excursions worthwhile for inexperienced travelers. However, established operators like Jamaica Tours Ltd provide reliable independent options. Dunn's River Falls can be done independently, but guides enhance the experience and safety. Grand Cayman's tender port creates logistics challenges. Ship excursions guarantee tender priority, valuable with 4-5 ships in port. Seven Mile Beach is free via $5 public bus rides. Stingray City tours are comparable prices ship versus local operators. Book early - limited boats mean sellouts. St. Thomas offers easy independent exploration from downtown dock. Magen's Bay ($5 taxi each way, $5 entry) beats $60 ship beach excursions. Paradise Point Skyride and Coral World are walkable or cheap taxi rides. Duty-free shopping downtown requires no tours. Nassau's proximity to Essex County makes it familiar for many cruisers. Atlantis day passes ($200+) aren't worth it - visit free areas like Marina Village instead. Blue Lagoon Island and swimming with dolphins require advance booking. Downtown shopping and Queens Staircase are easy walks from port.","position":3},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Alaska and Specialty Port Planning","text":"Alaska cruising from Seattle or Vancouver requires different excursion strategies than Caribbean sailings. Weather unpredictability, wildlife viewing opportunities, and remote locations favor organized tours. Glacier Bay and Hubbard Glacier scenic cruising days don't require excursions - enjoy from deck. Juneau offers accessible attractions: Mount Roberts Tramway ($44) provides views and hiking without tours. Mendenhall Glacier shuttles cost $35 roundtrip versus $90 ship transfers. Whale watching guarantees similar whether booked through ship or independently, but ship tours offer refunds for no sightings. Skagway's White Pass Railway should be booked through the ship or directly with the railway months ahead - it sells out. Independent booking saves minimally but risks logistics issues. The Klondike Highway bus tour offers similar views at lower prices. Ketchikan's Creek Street and totem poles are walkable from dock. Misty Fjords seaplane tours cost the same independently with more flexibility. Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show tickets are cheaper at the venue than pre-purchased. European ports require extensive planning. Mediterranean destinations often dock far from city centers - Civitavecchia (Rome) is 90 minutes away, requiring coordinated transportation. Ship transfers might seem expensive but provide reliability. Barcelona, Venice, and Copenhagen dock centrally, perfect for independent exploration. Pre-purchase museum tickets online to skip lines. Bermuda's multiple overnight stays allow leisurely independent exploration. Buy transportation passes covering buses and ferries. Beaches are free and accessible by public transit. Skip ship beach transfers costing $40-60 per person.","position":4},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Safety and Practical Considerations","text":"Excursion safety extends beyond choosing reputable operators. Understanding local conditions, preparing properly, and maintaining awareness prevents problems. Research State Department advisories for each port, understanding areas to avoid. Some Caribbean islands have significant crime outside tourist zones - St. Lucia, Trinidad, and parts of Jamaica require extra caution. Health preparations matter more than many Essex County residents realize. Tropical sun intensity, humidity, and exertion combine dangerously. Hydrate extensively, apply reef-safe sunscreen hourly, and recognize heat exhaustion symptoms. Pack medications in original containers - some countries restrict common drugs. Bring copies of prescriptions. Consider altitude (Mexico City tours), water safety (don't drink tap water many places), and food precautions. Communication planning prevents issues. International roaming charges shock many cruisers. Purchase local SIM cards for cheap communication or rely on WiFi at cafes. Download offline maps before leaving ship. Screenshot return instructions and ship contact information. Share itineraries with travel companions. Physical fitness impacts excursion enjoyment. Be realistic about abilities - that rainforest hike or zip-line adventure might exceed comfort levels. Many tours involve significant walking on uneven surfaces. Water activities require swimming ability. Disclose medical conditions to operators. Age restrictions exist for many activities. Money management requires strategy. Bring small bills for tips and purchases - many vendors can't break large denominations. Use credit cards cautiously - fraud is common in tourist areas. Notify banks of travel plans to prevent card freezes. Keep copies of important documents separate from originals.","position":5}]},{"@type":"FAQPage","@id":"https://nexttripanywhere.com/travel-guides/cruise-excursion-planning#faq","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"How far in advance should I book cruise excursions?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Popular excursions like swimming with dolphins, exclusive beach clubs, or small-group tours should be booked 60-90 days before sailing when ship bookings open.

Simply walk off the ship (or take tenders where required) and explore. Many ports have attractions within walking distance or easy taxi rides. This works especially well in developed ports like Key West, St. Thomas, or Bermuda. Always carry ship identification and return well before all-aboard time."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I book excursions through the cruise line or third party?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Book through the cruise line when: timing is tight, logistics are complex, safety is questionable, or missing the experience would ruin your trip. Book independently when: ports are safe and developed, activities are simple, you have adequate time buffer, or significant savings justify minimal risk.

22:T695,The fundamental excursion decision involves choosing between cruise line-sponsored tours and independent exploration. Ship excursions offer significant advantages: guaranteed return to ship (they'll wait or fly you to the next port if tours run late), vetted operators meeting safety standards, organized logistics with transportation included, guides speaking English, and refunds for cancelled ports. However, these conveniences cost 40-100% more than identical independent tours. Cruise lines mark up local operator prices substantially, knowing many passengers prioritize convenience and security. Independent excursions through companies like Viator, GetYourGuide, or local operators offer the same experiences at lower prices. That $150 per person Mayan ruins tour from the ship might cost $60 through local operators. Small group sizes provide intimate experiences versus ship tours with 50+ participants. However, you bear all risks: if your tour runs late, the ship leaves without you. Travel insurance rarely covers missed departures from non-ship excursions. Research operators thoroughly, checking recent reviews and safety records. Ensure operators have proper licensing and insurance. Build buffer time - return to ship at least 60-90 minutes before all-aboard time. Consider hybrid approaches for optimal value and security. Book complex excursions requiring extensive logistics through the ship (diving, adventure sports, remote destinations). Arrange simple activities independently (beaches, shopping, city tours). This strategy balances cost savings with risk management, particularly important for Essex County families traveling with children or elderly relatives.20:["$","div",null,{"className":"py-12 bg-gray-50","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"lg:grid lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-8","children":[["$","article",null,{"className":"lg:col-span-2","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 mb-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-4 text-sm text-gray-600","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-1","children":["$","span",null,{"children":["📅 Last updated: ","1/22/2025"]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-1","children":["$","span",null,{"children":["📚 Type:"," ","Planning"]}]}],"$undefined"]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8","children":["$","p",null,{"className":"text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700","children":"Shore excursions are often the highlight of any cruise, offering chances to explore new destinations and create lasting memories.

2d:T67b,Successful excursion planning begins months before your cruise. Start with comprehensive port research understanding each destination's highlights, logistics, and safety considerations. Cruise Critic forums provide invaluable real-world experiences from recent visitors. YouTube port guides show exactly what to expect. Facebook cruise groups share current pricing and recommendations. Create port priority lists ranking must-see attractions versus nice-to-have options. Popular ports like Cozumel or Nassau offer overwhelming choices requiring focus. Understand your interests: history buffs might prioritize ruins while families may prefer beaches. Consider physical requirements - many Essex County seniors underestimate Caribbean heat and excursion activity levels. Determine port logistics early. Some ports dock directly downtown (Key West, Bermuda) making independent exploration easy. Others require tender boats to shore or dock in industrial areas far from attractions (Belize, Grand Cayman), favoring organized tours. Research transportation options: reliable taxis, public transit, or ship shuttles. Understand local currency, tipping customs, and language barriers. Book popular excursions early, whether through ships or independently. Swimming with dolphins, exclusive beach clubs, and small-group tours sell out months ahead. However, some excursions offer last-minute discounts for unsold spots - check the night before in port. Weather significantly impacts excursions. Have backup plans for rain, rough seas, or excessive heat. Beach days need alternatives when weather disappoints. Museums and shopping provide weather-independent options.25:["$","section","1",{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6","children":"Researching and Planning Port Activities"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed mb-6","children":"$2d"}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6 p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4","children":"Checklist:"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-3","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Research ports 2-3 months ahead"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Read Cruise Critic forums"}]]}],["$","div","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Watch YouTube guides"}]]}],["$","div","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Create priority lists"}]]}],["$","div","4",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Understand dock locations"}]]}],["$","div","5",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Check transportation options"}]]}],["$","div","6",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Book popular tours early"}]]}],["$","div","7",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],"$L2e"]}]]}]]}],"$undefined"]}]]}]
2f:T675,Caribbean ports from Cape Liberty cruises each offer unique opportunities and challenges. Cozumel, Mexico's cruise capital, excels for diving and beach clubs. Mr. Sancho's Beach Club ($60 per person) includes food, drinks, and facilities - cheaper than ship beach excursions. Taxis to Playa Palancar cost $15 each way for gorgeous public beaches. Chankanaab Park offers snorkeling, dolphins, and cultural shows independently for half ship prices. Jamaica (Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, Falmouth) requires more caution. Aggressive vendors and safety concerns make ship excursions worthwhile for inexperienced travelers. However, established operators like Jamaica Tours Ltd provide reliable independent options. Dunn's River Falls can be done independently, but guides enhance the experience and safety. Grand Cayman's tender port creates logistics challenges. Ship excursions guarantee tender priority, valuable with 4-5 ships in port. Seven Mile Beach is free via $5 public bus rides. Stingray City tours are comparable prices ship versus local operators. Book early - limited boats mean sellouts. St. Thomas offers easy independent exploration from downtown dock. Magen's Bay ($5 taxi each way, $5 entry) beats $60 ship beach excursions. Paradise Point Skyride and Coral World are walkable or cheap taxi rides. Duty-free shopping downtown requires no tours. Nassau's proximity to Essex County makes it familiar for many cruisers. Atlantis day passes ($200+) aren't worth it - visit free areas like Marina Village instead. Blue Lagoon Island and swimming with dolphins require advance booking. Downtown shopping and Queens Staircase are easy walks from port.26:["$","section","2",{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6","children":"Caribbean Port Strategies"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed mb-6","children":"$2f"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4","children":"Key Tips:"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Cozumel: Beach clubs offer best value"}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Jamaica: Consider ship tours for safety"}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Grand Cayman: Book Stingray City early"}]]}],["$","li","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"St. Thomas: Easy independent exploration"}]]}],["$","li","4",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Nassau: Skip expensive Atlantis passes"}]]}]]}]]}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6 p-4 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm font-medium text-yellow-900","children":"Local Tip:"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-yellow-800 mt-1","children":"Essex County's Caribbean expatriate communities provide insider recommendations - check with West Indian associations in Newark and East Orange for authentic local experiences."}]]}]]}]]}]
30:T6ad,Alaska cruising from Seattle or Vancouver requires different excursion strategies than Caribbean sailings. Weather unpredictability, wildlife viewing opportunities, and remote locations favor organized tours. Glacier Bay and Hubbard Glacier scenic cruising days don't require excursions - enjoy from deck. Juneau offers accessible attractions: Mount Roberts Tramway ($44) provides views and hiking without tours. Mendenhall Glacier shuttles cost $35 roundtrip versus $90 ship transfers. Whale watching guarantees similar whether booked through ship or independently, but ship tours offer refunds for no sightings. Skagway's White Pass Railway should be booked through the ship or directly with the railway months ahead - it sells out. Independent booking saves minimally but risks logistics issues. The Klondike Highway bus tour offers similar views at lower prices. Ketchikan's Creek Street and totem poles are walkable from dock. Misty Fjords seaplane tours cost the same independently with more flexibility. Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show tickets are cheaper at the venue than pre-purchased. European ports require extensive planning. Mediterranean destinations often dock far from city centers - Civitavecchia (Rome) is 90 minutes away, requiring coordinated transportation. Ship transfers might seem expensive but provide reliability. Barcelona, Venice, and Copenhagen dock centrally, perfect for independent exploration. Pre-purchase museum tickets online to skip lines. Bermuda's multiple overnight stays allow leisurely independent exploration. Buy transportation passes covering buses and ferries. Beaches are free and accessible by public transit. Skip ship beach transfers costing $40-60 per person.27:["$","section","3",{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6","children":"Alaska and Specialty Port Planning"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed mb-6","children":"$30"}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6 p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4","children":"Checklist:"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-3","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Alaska: Book wildlife tours early"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Europe: Pre-purchase museum tickets"}]]}],["$","div","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Bermuda: Get transportation passes"}]]}],["$","div","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Research dock distances"}]]}],["$","div","4",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Consider weather impacts"}]]}],["$","div","5",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Book trains/flights early"}]]}]]}]]}],"$undefined"]}]]}]
31:T6fa,Excursion safety extends beyond choosing reputable operators. Understanding local conditions, preparing properly, and maintaining awareness prevents problems. Research State Department advisories for each port, understanding areas to avoid. Some Caribbean islands have significant crime outside tourist zones - St. Lucia, Trinidad, and parts of Jamaica require extra caution. Health preparations matter more than many Essex County residents realize. Tropical sun intensity, humidity, and exertion combine dangerously. Hydrate extensively, apply reef-safe sunscreen hourly, and recognize heat exhaustion symptoms. Pack medications in original containers - some countries restrict common drugs. Bring copies of prescriptions. Consider altitude (Mexico City tours), water safety (don't drink tap water many places), and food precautions. Communication planning prevents issues. International roaming charges shock many cruisers. Purchase local SIM cards for cheap communication or rely on WiFi at cafes. Download offline maps before leaving ship. Screenshot return instructions and ship contact information. Share itineraries with travel companions. Physical fitness impacts excursion enjoyment. Be realistic about abilities - that rainforest hike or zip-line adventure might exceed comfort levels. Many tours involve significant walking on uneven surfaces. Water activities require swimming ability. Disclose medical conditions to operators. Age restrictions exist for many activities. Money management requires strategy. Bring small bills for tips and purchases - many vendors can't break large denominations. Use credit cards cautiously - fraud is common in tourist areas. Notify banks of travel plans to prevent card freezes. Keep copies of important documents separate from originals.28:["$","section","4",{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6","children":"Safety and Practical Considerations"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed mb-6","children":"$31"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4","children":"Key Tips:"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Check State Department advisories"}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Prepare for intense tropical conditions"}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Plan communication strategy"}]]}],["$","li","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Be realistic about fitness levels"}]]}],["$","li","4",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Bring small bills for tips"}]]}],["$","li","5",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],"$L32"]}]]}]]}],"$undefined","$undefined"]}]]}]
