However, understanding these guidelines remains essential for comfortable cruising. Daytime dress codes are universally relaxed across all cruise lines - resort casual reigns supreme. Think comfortable vacation wear: shorts, sundresses, t-shirts, polo shirts, and casual pants. Swimwear is perfect for pool decks but requires cover-ups when moving through indoor spaces or dining areas. Evening dress codes vary by cruise line and venue. Main dining rooms and specialty restaurants enforce dress guidelines after 6 PM, while buffets remain casual. Most mainstream lines (Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Carnival sailing from Cape Liberty) have 2-3 dress code categories: Casual (smart casual), Smart Casual (formerly informal), and Formal (optional on many lines). Casual nights allow nice jeans, polo shirts, sundresses, and casual slacks - think restaurant-appropriate attire. Smart Casual ups the ante with dress pants, button-down shirts, blouses, skirts, and dresses. Formal nights suggest cocktail attire: suits or sport coats for men, cocktail dresses or elegant pantsuits for women. Norwegian Cruise Line pioneered 'Freestyle Cruising' with relaxed dress codes - you'll never be turned away from dinner, though some specialty restaurants maintain standards. Luxury lines like Regent and Silversea actually maintain stricter codes despite their 'country club casual' marketing. Disney Cruise Line offers optional formal nights with most passengers participating enthusiastically, especially families from Essex County celebrating special occasions.","position":1},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Formal Night Attire","text":"Formal nights remain a cruise tradition, though interpretation varies widely. On 7-night cruises, expect 1-2 formal nights, usually on sea days when photographers are working. Modern formal nights are more 'dress-up night' than strictly formal - think wedding guest attire rather than black-tie gala. For men, the spectrum runs from dark jeans with a blazer (acceptable on casual lines) to full tuxedos (rare but appreciated). Most opt for middle ground: dress pants, button-down shirt, and optional jacket or tie. Sport coats with khakis work well. Dark colors photograph better against ship interiors. Essex County business travelers often pack their work conference attire for formal nights. Women have endless options from cocktail dresses to dressy pantsuits. Little black dresses remain the cruise formal night staple - versatile, packable, and appropriate for any cruise line. Maxi dresses offer elegance with comfort. Dressy separates allow mix-and-match options without packing multiple outfits. Avoid super-short hemlines and excessive sparkle that reads 'nightclub' rather than 'elegant dinner.' Accessories elevate casual outfits to formal-appropriate. A pashmina or wrap serves double duty for air-conditioned dining rooms and breezy deck photos. Statement jewelry transforms simple dresses. Men can upgrade casual shirts with ties or pocket squares. Comfortable dress shoes are crucial - you'll walk more than expected on ships. Many Essex County cruisers buy new formal wear specifically for cruises. Jersey Gardens outlet mall offers discounted designer formal wear. Rent the Runway, available for pickup in Secaucus, provides designer dress rentals for special occasions without the commitment of purchasing.","position":2},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Smart Casual and Casual Night Options","text":"Smart casual nights dominate modern cruise schedules, requiring a step up from daytime wear without formal night pressure. This dress code confuses many first-time cruisers from Essex County suburbs where 'smart casual' isn't common terminology. Think 'nice restaurant' or 'country club' attire - polished but not formal. Men succeed with khakis or dress pants paired with polo shirts or button-downs. Jeans are increasingly acceptable if dark and well-fitted, paired with a collared shirt. Avoid cargo shorts, athletic wear, tank tops, and flip-flops in main dining rooms. Blazers instantly elevate any outfit but aren't required. Women can wear sundresses, skirts with nice tops, dressy capris, or casual dresses. Maxi dresses work perfectly - comfortable yet elegant. Dressy sandals are fine; avoid rubber flip-flops. Nice jeans with dressy tops now pass on most cruise lines except luxury brands. Regular casual nights (increasingly common) allow even more flexibility. Think 'business casual Friday' - nice jeans, polo shirts, casual button-downs, sundresses, or casual skirts. The key is looking 'put together' rather than beach-ready. Some Essex County cruisers struggle with this relaxed approach, overdressing from habit. Remember: you're on vacation. Comfort matters more than impressing strangers you'll never see again. Pack versatile pieces that mix and match. A few quality basics beat numerous specific outfits. Neutral colors coordinate easily and hide stains from inevitable spills on moving ships.","position":3},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Daytime and Pool Attire","text":"Daytime cruise wear prioritizes comfort and sun protection. The Caribbean sun intensity surprises many New Jersey residents accustomed to milder Northeast UV levels. Pack lightweight, breathable fabrics that dry quickly - ships' humidity makes cotton uncomfortable. Moisture-wicking athletic wear has become standard cruise attire. For pool and sun deck time, bring multiple swimsuits allowing rotation while others dry. Two-piece or one-piece depends on personal preference and cruise demographics - family cruises see more modest choices while adult-only lines trend toward fashionable swimwear. Cover-ups are essential for moving through the ship. Sarongs, sundresses, or oversized shirts work well. Many cruise lines prohibit wearing just swimwear in elevators or indoor corridors. Athletic wear dominates casual daytime options: yoga pants, athletic shorts, moisture-wicking t-shirts. The ship gym and sports courts see heavy use on sea days. Pack dedicated workout clothes if you plan to exercise. Walking/running shoes are essential for deck laps - many Essex County residents maintain fitness routines while cruising. Shore excursion days require activity-appropriate attire. Beach days need swim gear and water shoes. City tours demand comfortable walking attire and broken-in shoes. Adventure excursions might require long pants and closed shoes. Research your specific ports and planned activities. Accessories matter in sunny destinations. Wide-brimmed hats protect better than baseball caps. Sunglasses with UV protection are essential. Reef-safe sunscreen (required in many ports) should be applied liberally and frequently.","position":4},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Destination-Specific Clothing","text":"Different cruise regions require vastly different wardrobes. Caribbean cruises from Cape Liberty need lightweight, breathable clothing with serious sun protection. Pack mainly shorts, tank tops, sundresses, and sandals. A light rain jacket handles afternoon showers common in tropical ports. Bug spray for jungle excursions is essential. The humidity will shock Essex County residents - pack extra everything as you'll sweat through clothes quickly. Alaska cruises demand layers regardless of season. Even July sees temperatures in the 50s-60s with rain common. Pack waterproof jackets, fleece or wool layers, long pants, and waterproof hiking boots. Gloves and hats aren't overkill. The ship's interior remains warm, so you'll constantly add/remove layers. Many Newark-area outdoor stores like REI in Paramus offer Alaska-appropriate gear. Mediterranean cruises require modest clothing for religious sites. Women need scarves for shoulders and pants/long skirts for churches. Men should pack long pants and shirts with sleeves. Comfortable walking shoes handle cobblestone streets better than sandals. Europeans dress more formally than Americans - you'll feel underdressed in athletic wear at cafes. Northern Europe and Baltic cruises need similar wardrobes to Alaska but with dressier options for sophisticated cities like Copenhagen and Stockholm. Transatlantic crossings feature multiple formal nights given the journey's classic nature. Pack extra formal and smart casual options. Sea days dominate, so comfortable lounge wear matters more than shore excursion clothes.","position":5}]},{"@type":"FAQPage","@id":"https://nexttripanywhere.com/travel-guides/what-to-wear-on-cruise#faq","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you wear jeans on a cruise?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, jeans are now acceptable on most cruise lines during casual and smart casual evenings. Dark, well-fitted jeans paired with a nice top or collared shirt work for most dining rooms. Avoid distressed, torn, or overly casual jeans. Luxury lines and formal nights still discourage jeans.

Pack one versatile formal outfit that can be accessorized differently for variety. Men can wear the same suit with different shirts/ties. Women can transform one dress with different accessories.

High heels struggle on moving ships - opt for wedges or block heels. Skip expensive jewelry that attracts thieves in ports."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do cruise ships provide formal wear rentals?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Some cruise lines offer formal wear rentals, but availability is limited and expensive. Cruise Formal Wear and similar services deliver rentals to your cabin, but must be reserved weeks in advance. Costs often exceed purchasing options at discount retailers.

22:T6b7,Modern cruise lines have evolved their dress codes significantly, moving away from rigid requirements toward 'suggested attire' that gives passengers more flexibility. However, understanding these guidelines remains essential for comfortable cruising. Daytime dress codes are universally relaxed across all cruise lines - resort casual reigns supreme. Think comfortable vacation wear: shorts, sundresses, t-shirts, polo shirts, and casual pants. Swimwear is perfect for pool decks but requires cover-ups when moving through indoor spaces or dining areas. Evening dress codes vary by cruise line and venue. Main dining rooms and specialty restaurants enforce dress guidelines after 6 PM, while buffets remain casual. Most mainstream lines (Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Carnival sailing from Cape Liberty) have 2-3 dress code categories: Casual (smart casual), Smart Casual (formerly informal), and Formal (optional on many lines). Casual nights allow nice jeans, polo shirts, sundresses, and casual slacks - think restaurant-appropriate attire. Smart Casual ups the ante with dress pants, button-down shirts, blouses, skirts, and dresses. Formal nights suggest cocktail attire: suits or sport coats for men, cocktail dresses or elegant pantsuits for women. Norwegian Cruise Line pioneered 'Freestyle Cruising' with relaxed dress codes - you'll never be turned away from dinner, though some specialty restaurants maintain standards. Luxury lines like Regent and Silversea actually maintain stricter codes despite their 'country club casual' marketing. Disney Cruise Line offers optional formal nights with most passengers participating enthusiastically, especially families from Essex County celebrating special occasions.20:["$","div",null,{"className":"py-12 bg-gray-50","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"lg:grid lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-8","children":[["$","article",null,{"className":"lg:col-span-2","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 mb-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-4 text-sm text-gray-600","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-1","children":["$","span",null,{"children":["📅 Last updated: ","1/22/2025"]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-1","children":["$","span",null,{"children":["📚 Type:"," ","Packing"]}]}],"$undefined"]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8","children":["$","p",null,{"className":"text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700","children":"Figuring out what to wear on a cruise can be surprisingly complex, with different dress codes for various times of day, dining venues, and activities.

2d:T6bd,Formal nights remain a cruise tradition, though interpretation varies widely. On 7-night cruises, expect 1-2 formal nights, usually on sea days when photographers are working. Modern formal nights are more 'dress-up night' than strictly formal - think wedding guest attire rather than black-tie gala. For men, the spectrum runs from dark jeans with a blazer (acceptable on casual lines) to full tuxedos (rare but appreciated). Most opt for middle ground: dress pants, button-down shirt, and optional jacket or tie. Sport coats with khakis work well. Dark colors photograph better against ship interiors. Essex County business travelers often pack their work conference attire for formal nights. Women have endless options from cocktail dresses to dressy pantsuits. Little black dresses remain the cruise formal night staple - versatile, packable, and appropriate for any cruise line. Maxi dresses offer elegance with comfort. Dressy separates allow mix-and-match options without packing multiple outfits. Avoid super-short hemlines and excessive sparkle that reads 'nightclub' rather than 'elegant dinner.' Accessories elevate casual outfits to formal-appropriate. A pashmina or wrap serves double duty for air-conditioned dining rooms and breezy deck photos. Statement jewelry transforms simple dresses. Men can upgrade casual shirts with ties or pocket squares. Comfortable dress shoes are crucial - you'll walk more than expected on ships. Many Essex County cruisers buy new formal wear specifically for cruises. Jersey Gardens outlet mall offers discounted designer formal wear. Rent the Runway, available for pickup in Secaucus, provides designer dress rentals for special occasions without the commitment of purchasing.25:["$","section","1",{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6","children":"Formal Night Attire"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed mb-6","children":"$2d"}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6 p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4","children":"Checklist:"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-3","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Men: Dress pants, button-down shirt, optional jacket/tie"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Women: Cocktail dress or elegant pantsuit"}]]}],["$","div","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Comfortable dress shoes"}]]}],["$","div","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Accessories to elevate outfits"}]]}],["$","div","4",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Wraps for cold dining rooms"}]]}],["$","div","5",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Avoid overly casual items like shorts"}]]}],["$","div","6",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Consider renting special occasion wear"}]]}]]}]]}],"$undefined"]}]]}]
2e:T5eb,Smart casual nights dominate modern cruise schedules, requiring a step up from daytime wear without formal night pressure. This dress code confuses many first-time cruisers from Essex County suburbs where 'smart casual' isn't common terminology. Think 'nice restaurant' or 'country club' attire - polished but not formal. Men succeed with khakis or dress pants paired with polo shirts or button-downs. Jeans are increasingly acceptable if dark and well-fitted, paired with a collared shirt. Avoid cargo shorts, athletic wear, tank tops, and flip-flops in main dining rooms. Blazers instantly elevate any outfit but aren't required. Women can wear sundresses, skirts with nice tops, dressy capris, or casual dresses. Maxi dresses work perfectly - comfortable yet elegant. Dressy sandals are fine; avoid rubber flip-flops. Nice jeans with dressy tops now pass on most cruise lines except luxury brands. Regular casual nights (increasingly common) allow even more flexibility. Think 'business casual Friday' - nice jeans, polo shirts, casual button-downs, sundresses, or casual skirts. The key is looking 'put together' rather than beach-ready. Some Essex County cruisers struggle with this relaxed approach, overdressing from habit. Remember: you're on vacation. Comfort matters more than impressing strangers you'll never see again. Pack versatile pieces that mix and match. A few quality basics beat numerous specific outfits. Neutral colors coordinate easily and hide stains from inevitable spills on moving ships.26:["$","section","2",{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6","children":"Smart Casual and Casual Night Options"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed mb-6","children":"$2e"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4","children":"Key Tips:"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Versatile pieces that mix and match"}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Neutral colors coordinate easily"}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Layers for temperature control"}]]}],["$","li","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Comfortable shoes for ship movement"}]]}],["$","li","4",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Avoid athletic wear in dining rooms"}]]}]]}]]}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6 p-4 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm font-medium text-yellow-900","children":"Local Tip:"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-yellow-800 mt-1","children":"Target in West Orange and Old Navy in Livingston offer affordable smart casual options perfect for cruise wear without breaking the budget."}]]}]]}]]}]
2f:T666,Daytime cruise wear prioritizes comfort and sun protection. The Caribbean sun intensity surprises many New Jersey residents accustomed to milder Northeast UV levels. Pack lightweight, breathable fabrics that dry quickly - ships' humidity makes cotton uncomfortable. Moisture-wicking athletic wear has become standard cruise attire. For pool and sun deck time, bring multiple swimsuits allowing rotation while others dry. Two-piece or one-piece depends on personal preference and cruise demographics - family cruises see more modest choices while adult-only lines trend toward fashionable swimwear. Cover-ups are essential for moving through the ship. Sarongs, sundresses, or oversized shirts work well. Many cruise lines prohibit wearing just swimwear in elevators or indoor corridors. Athletic wear dominates casual daytime options: yoga pants, athletic shorts, moisture-wicking t-shirts. The ship gym and sports courts see heavy use on sea days. Pack dedicated workout clothes if you plan to exercise. Walking/running shoes are essential for deck laps - many Essex County residents maintain fitness routines while cruising. Shore excursion days require activity-appropriate attire. Beach days need swim gear and water shoes. City tours demand comfortable walking attire and broken-in shoes. Adventure excursions might require long pants and closed shoes. Research your specific ports and planned activities. Accessories matter in sunny destinations. Wide-brimmed hats protect better than baseball caps. Sunglasses with UV protection are essential. Reef-safe sunscreen (required in many ports) should be applied liberally and frequently.27:["$","section","3",{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6","children":"Daytime and Pool Attire"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed mb-6","children":"$2f"}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6 p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4","children":"Checklist:"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-3","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Multiple swimsuits for rotation"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Cover-ups for public areas"}]]}],["$","div","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Athletic wear for activities"}]]}],["$","div","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Comfortable walking shoes"}]]}],["$","div","4",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Sun protection accessories"}]]}],["$","div","5",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Water shoes for beaches"}]]}],["$","div","6",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Quick-dry fabrics"}]]}],["$","div","7",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","input",null,{"type":"checkbox","className":"mt-1 mr-3"}],["$","label",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Reef-safe sunscreen"}]]}]]}]]}],"$undefined"]}]]}]
30:T627,Different cruise regions require vastly different wardrobes. Caribbean cruises from Cape Liberty need lightweight, breathable clothing with serious sun protection. Pack mainly shorts, tank tops, sundresses, and sandals. A light rain jacket handles afternoon showers common in tropical ports. Bug spray for jungle excursions is essential. The humidity will shock Essex County residents - pack extra everything as you'll sweat through clothes quickly. Alaska cruises demand layers regardless of season. Even July sees temperatures in the 50s-60s with rain common. Pack waterproof jackets, fleece or wool layers, long pants, and waterproof hiking boots. Gloves and hats aren't overkill. The ship's interior remains warm, so you'll constantly add/remove layers. Many Newark-area outdoor stores like REI in Paramus offer Alaska-appropriate gear. Mediterranean cruises require modest clothing for religious sites. Women need scarves for shoulders and pants/long skirts for churches. Men should pack long pants and shirts with sleeves. Comfortable walking shoes handle cobblestone streets better than sandals. Europeans dress more formally than Americans - you'll feel underdressed in athletic wear at cafes. Northern Europe and Baltic cruises need similar wardrobes to Alaska but with dressier options for sophisticated cities like Copenhagen and Stockholm. Transatlantic crossings feature multiple formal nights given the journey's classic nature. Pack extra formal and smart casual options. Sea days dominate, so comfortable lounge wear matters more than shore excursion clothes.28:["$","section","4",{"className":"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-8 mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6","children":"Destination-Specific Clothing"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"leading-relaxed mb-6","children":"$30"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4","children":"Key Tips:"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Caribbean: Lightweight, breathable, sun protection"}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Alaska: Waterproof layers, hiking boots"}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Mediterranean: Modest options for religious sites"}]]}],["$","li","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Northern Europe: Layers plus city-appropriate attire"}]]}],["$","li","4",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"w-5 h-5 text-green-500 mt-1 mr-3 flex-shrink-0","children":"✓"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Research specific ports for requirements"}]]}]]}]]}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6 p-4 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm font-medium text-yellow-900","children":"Local Tip:"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-yellow-800 mt-1","children":"Eastern Mountain Sports in Paramus provides expert advice on technical clothing for Alaska and Northern Europe cruises, with seasonal sales in February-March."}]]}]]}]]}]
