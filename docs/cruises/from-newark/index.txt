Caribbean cruises are the most popular, with itineraries to the Eastern Caribbean (St. Thomas, St. Maarten, Puerto Rico), Western Caribbean (Cozumel, Jamaica, Grand Cayman), and Southern Caribbean (Aruba, Barbados, Curacao). Bermuda cruises run from April through October, offering 7-night voyages with 2-3 days docked at King's Wharf. Quick Bahamas getaways visit Nassau and private islands like Perfect Day at CocoCay. Seasonal offerings include Canada/New England fall foliage cruises (September-October) and repositioning cruises to Europe (spring and fall). The variety means Essex County residents can find everything from 3-day weekend escapes to 15-day transatlantic adventures."}]]}]

For the lowest prices, book during 'Wave Season' (January-March) when cruise lines offer their best promotions, including reduced deposits, onboard credits, and free upgrades. For the best selection of cabins and itineraries, book 6-12 months in advance, especially for popular times like spring break, summer, and holidays. Last-minute deals (30-60 days before sailing) can offer exceptional value if you're flexible with dates and cabin categories. Essex County residents should also consider off-season advantages: fewer crowds at the port, easier parking, and often better prices. September-November (excluding Thanksgiving) and late January-early March typically offer the best combination of weather and value for Caribbean cruises."}]]}]

For closed-loop cruises (departing and returning to the same U.S. port) to the Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda, U.S. citizens can use a government-issued birth certificate and driver's license, though a passport is strongly recommended. For any cruise that visits Canada, a passport or passport card is required. International cruises and one-way cruises require a valid passport. Non-U.S. citizens should bring their green card or visa along with their passport. Children under 16 on closed-loop cruises can use just a birth certificate. We recommend all Essex County travelers get a passport for cruising - it provides the most flexibility and is required if you need to fly home from a foreign port due to emergency. Remember to check expiration dates: many countries require passports valid for 6 months beyond travel dates."}]]}]
