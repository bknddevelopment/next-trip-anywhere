2a:T503,Antigua enchants honeymooners and couples from Essex County with its legendary claim of a different beach for every day of the year, ranging from bustling strips with beach bars to secluded coves accessible only by boat. This heart-shaped island in the Eastern Caribbean combines British colonial charm with laid-back island vibes, creating the perfect romantic atmosphere without the commercialization of larger Caribbean destinations. Direct flights from Newark Airport (with one stop) bring you to an island where every beach offers something unique - from the 17-mile stretch of pristine sand at Half Moon Bay to the calm, crystal-clear waters of Dickenson Bay, and the dramatic Atlantic waves at Devil's Bridge. Antigua's position in the Leeward Islands provides consistently perfect weather with less rainfall than western Caribbean destinations, while its sophisticated dining scene, historical sites like Nelson's Dockyard, and luxury resorts including the romantic Sandals Grande Antigua create a complete honeymoon experience. The island's compact size means couples can explore multiple beaches, enjoy sunset sailing, and still have plenty of time for relaxation at their resort, making it ideal for those who want both adventure and romance during their Caribbean escape.27:["$","section",null,{"className":"py-16","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container mx-auto px-4","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8","children":"$2a"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-8 mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-6","children":"Destination Highlights"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"365 beaches - one for every day"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"English-speaking island"}]]}],["$","div","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Sandals Grande adults-only resort"}]]}],["$","div","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Historical Nelson's Dockyard"}]]}],"$L2b","$L2c","$L2d","$L2e"]}]]}],"$L2f","$L30","$L31"]}]}]}]}]
