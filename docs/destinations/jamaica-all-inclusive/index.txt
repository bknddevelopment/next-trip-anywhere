2a:T4a1,Jamaica captivates Essex County travelers with its intoxicating blend of pristine beaches, reggae rhythms, flavorful cuisine, and warm hospitality, all easily accessible via frequent direct flights from Newark Airport. As the birthplace of all-inclusive resorts, Jamaica perfected the art of worry-free vacations where everything from gourmet dining to water sports is included in one upfront price. The island offers distinct experiences across its resort areas - Montego Bay's convenience and variety, Negril's legendary seven-mile beach and sunsets, Ocho Rios's lush gardens and waterfalls, and the South Coast's untouched authenticity. Jamaica's unique culture sets it apart from other Caribbean islands, offering experiences from climbing Dunn's River Falls to touring Bob Marley's former home, rafting the Martha Brae River to sampling jerk chicken from roadside drums. With options ranging from family-friendly resorts with extensive kids' programs to sophisticated adults-only properties like Sandals and Couples, Jamaica provides the perfect setting for any vacation style while maintaining the value pricing that makes it accessible for New Jersey families and couples alike.27:["$","section",null,{"className":"py-16","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container mx-auto px-4","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8","children":"$2a"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-8 mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-6","children":"Destination Highlights"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"3.5 hour direct flights from Newark"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Birthplace of all-inclusive resorts"}]]}],["$","div","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"English-speaking island"}]]}],["$","div","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Reggae music and culture"}]]}],["$","div","4",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":"$L2b"}],"$L2c"]}],"$L2d","$L2e","$L2f"]}]]}],"$L30","$L31","$L32"]}]}]}]}]
