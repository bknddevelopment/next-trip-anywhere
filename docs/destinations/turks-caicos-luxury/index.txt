2a:T4cb,Turks and Caicos represents the pinnacle of Caribbean luxury for discerning Essex County travelers, featuring the world-renowned Grace Bay Beach with its 12 miles of powder-white sand and impossibly turquoise waters. This British Overseas Territory has carefully developed its tourism to maintain an exclusive, uncrowded feel while offering world-class resorts, restaurants, and services that rival any luxury destination globally. With direct flights from Newark Airport to Providenciales, accessing this paradise requires less travel time than reaching Hawaii, yet delivers an equally spectacular tropical experience. The islands' location at the edge of the Caribbean offers exceptional diving and snorkeling with the third-largest barrier reef system in the world, while the consistent trade winds create ideal conditions for kiteboarding and sailing. Unlike many Caribbean destinations, Turks and Caicos maintains strict development standards, resulting in no high-rises on Grace Bay Beach, pristine natural environments, and an upscale atmosphere that attracts celebrities and luxury travelers while remaining family-friendly with resorts like the expansive Beaches Turks & Caicos offering something for every generation.27:["$","section",null,{"className":"py-16","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container mx-auto px-4","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-lg max-w-none","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8","children":"$2a"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-8 mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-6","children":"Destination Highlights"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Grace Bay - World's #1 Beach multiple years"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"3.5 hour direct flights from Newark"}]]}],["$","div","2",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Pristine turquoise waters"}]]}],["$","div","3",{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"className":"w-6 h-6 text-green-500 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","fill":"currentColor","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","children":["$","path",null,{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M10 18a8 8 0 100-16 8 8 0 000 16zm3.707-9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414-1.414L9 10.586 7.707 9.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 1.414l2 2a1 1 0 001.414 0l4-4z","clipRule":"evenodd"}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-700","children":"Luxury resorts and villas"}]]}],"$L2b","$L2c","$L2d","$L2e"]}]]}],"$L2f","$L30","$L31"]}]}]}]}]
