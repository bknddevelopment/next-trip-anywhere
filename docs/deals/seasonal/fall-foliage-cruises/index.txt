Fall foliage cruises offer unparalleled photography opportunities with perspectives you can't get from land. Many ships offer photography workshops, and the golden hour light on autumn colors is spectacular. Bring a telephoto lens for distant shores and a wide angle for port scenes. Early morning provides the best light."},{"id":"faq-2","question":"What should I wear on a fall foliage cruise?","answer":"Layering is essential! Mornings can be 50°F while afternoons reach 70°F. Pack jeans, sweaters, light jacket, and comfortable walking shoes. Bring a warm coat for Canadian ports and evening deck time. Don't forget a rain jacket, scarf, and gloves for cooler evenings. Formal nights still apply, so pack accordingly."},{"id":"faq-3","question":"Do I need a passport for Canada/New England cruises?","answer":"Yes, a passport is required if your cruise visits Canadian ports (Halifax, Quebec City, etc.). Even though these are closed-loop cruises from Cape Liberty, Canada requires passports for entry. Pure New England cruises (Boston, Portland, Bar Harbor only) technically don't require passports but having one is strongly recommended."},{"id":"faq-4","question":"How do fall foliage cruises compare to Caribbean cruises?","answer":"Fall foliage cruises are more culturally enriching and scenic, while Caribbean cruises focus on beaches and water activities. Foliage cruises attract an older, quieter crowd interested in history, photography, and nature. They're perfect for couples and mature travelers seeking scenic beauty rather than party atmosphere. Expect cooler weather but breathtaking views."}]}]
