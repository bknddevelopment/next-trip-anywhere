The ship's chapel or theater transforms into a beautiful worship space with holiday decorations."},{"id":"faq-1","question":"How early should I book a Christmas cruise from Newark?","answer":"For the best selection and prices, book your Christmas cruise 6-11 months in advance.

If booking within 60 days, expect limited availability and higher prices, though last-minute deals occasionally appear for flexible travelers."},{"id":"faq-2","question":"What's the weather like for Christmas cruises to the Caribbean?","answer":"December offers perfect Caribbean cruise weather with temperatures between 75-85°F, low humidity, and minimal rainfall. The ocean is typically calm, and hurricane season has ended. Pack sunscreen and swimwear, but bring a light jacket for evening deck activities."},{"id":"faq-3","question":"Are Christmas cruises good for families with young children?","answer":"Absolutely! Christmas cruises are magical for children with Santa visits, cookie decorating, holiday movies, and special youth programs. Most ships offer complimentary childcare on Christmas Eve and extended kids club hours. Many lines offer 'kids sail free' promotions for holiday sailings."},{"id":"faq-4","question":"Do I need to bring Christmas decorations for my cabin?","answer":"While ships are beautifully decorated, many guests enjoy personalizing their cabins. Bring lightweight decorations like window clings, small ornaments, or battery-operated lights (no candles allowed). Some cruise lines offer cabin decoration packages you can pre-purchase."}]}]
