29:["$","$L37",null,{"faqs":[{"id":"faq-0","question":"Will the ship have a traditional Thanksgiving dinner?","answer":"Absolutely! Cruise lines serve elaborate traditional Thanksgiving feasts with roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes, green bean casserole, and multiple pie options. Most ships offer several dinner seatings plus a special lunch buffet. Vegetarian and international options are always available too."},{"id":"faq-1","question":"Can we watch football on Thanksgiving?","answer":"Yes! Ships show all NFL Thanksgiving games on multiple screens throughout the ship - sports bars, pool decks, and even in-cabin TVs. Many ships host viewing parties with wings, beer specials, and friendly competitions. Some even have tailgate-style events on deck."},{"id":"faq-2","question":"Is Thanksgiving week more expensive than regular cruises?","answer":"Thanksgiving week commands premium pricing due to high demand, typically 20-40% higher than non-holiday weeks. However, when you factor in what you'd spend on food, decorations, and hosting, plus the convenience and memories created, many find it excellent value. Book early for best rates."},{"id":"faq-3","question":"What's it like traveling during Thanksgiving week?","answer":"Driving to Cape Liberty is far easier than flying during Thanksgiving week. While airports are packed with delays, you'll cruise right to the port without the typical holiday travel stress. Ships depart on time regardless of weather delays affecting flights. Plus, you unpack once and wake up in paradise!"},{"id":"faq-4","question":"Do kids enjoy Thanksgiving cruises?","answer":"Kids love Thanksgiving cruises! No boring adult conversations at a long dinner table - instead, they enjoy kids clubs, pool time, games, and special Thanksgiving activities. Many ships offer kids-only Thanksgiving parties while parents enjoy adult dining. It becomes a favorite family tradition."}]}]
