Some 'Pack & Go' rates are available just days before departure. Have your passport ready, bags semi-packed, and be prepared to book immediately when deals appear. Cape Liberty's proximity makes truly last-minute possible!"},{"id":"faq-1","question":"Are last-minute August cruises actually cheaper?","answer":"Yes! August last-minute deals can save 40-60% off regular rates. Cruise lines prefer sailing full over leaving cabins empty. You might get a balcony for interior prices or score free upgrades. The trade-off is less choice in cabin location and dining times. If you"},{"id":"faq-2","question":"What's the hurricane risk for August cruises?","answer":"August is within hurricane season, but modern ships have sophisticated weather routing and rarely cancel. Ships simply sail around storms, maybe missing a port or changing itineraries. The risk is manageable, and cruise lines prioritize safety. Consider travel insurance for peace of mind, but don't let hurricane season stop you from great deals."},{"id":"faq-3","question":"Is August too hot for Caribbean cruises?","answer":"August is definitely hot (85-92°F) and humid in the Caribbean, but ships are heavily air-conditioned and pools provide relief. Choose itineraries with more sea days, book spa treatments, and enjoy indoor venues during peak heat. Early morning and evening activities are comfortable. Many people prefer the guaranteed sunshine despite the heat."},{"id":"faq-4","question":"How do upgrade auctions work for last-minute cruises?","answer":"About 30-45 days before sailing, cruise lines email eligible passengers inviting bids for upgrades. You offer what you're willing to pay above your current fare for a better cabin. If accepted, you're charged the bid amount. It's a great way to get a balcony or suite for less. Bid on multiple categories to increase chances."}]}]
