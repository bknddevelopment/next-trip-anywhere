29:["$","$L37",null,{"faqs":[{"id":"faq-0","question":"How do we get to Alaska cruises from New Jersey?","answer":"Most Essex County residents fly directly from Newark to Seattle (5.5 hours) or Vancouver (6 hours) where Alaska cruises depart. Book cruise line air for convenience or arrange independently for flexibility. Some combine with a cross-country road trip or scenic train journey. Consider arriving a day early to avoid missing the ship."},{"id":"faq-1","question":"Is summer the best time for an Alaska cruise?","answer":"Yes! June through August offers the warmest weather, longest days (nearly 20 hours of light), and full wildlife activity. All excursions operate, ports are fully accessible, and you'll see Alaska at its most vibrant. May and September offer lower prices but cooler weather and some limitations."},{"id":"faq-2","question":"What wildlife will we see on a summer Alaska cruise?","answer":"Summer brings incredible wildlife viewing: humpback and orca whales, brown and black bears (especially during salmon runs), bald eagles, sea otters, seals, sea lions, and countless seabirds. July-August is peak for bear viewing at salmon streams. Whales are active all summer. Every cruise sees significant wildlife."},{"id":"faq-3","question":"Are Alaska cruises good for kids?","answer":"Absolutely! Kids are fascinated by glaciers, whales, and wildlife. Ships offer Junior Ranger programs, educational activities, and family-friendly excursions. The adventure aspect keeps kids engaged while the ship provides familiar comforts. Many families call it their best vacation ever. The educational value is tremendous."},{"id":"faq-4","question":"What's the difference between Inside Passage and Glacier cruises?","answer":"Inside Passage cruises (7 days roundtrip from Seattle/Vancouver) focus on Southeast Alaska ports and typically include Glacier Bay. One-way Glacier cruises (7 days) travel further north into Gulf of Alaska, seeing more glaciers but requiring flights to/from Anchorage. Inside Passage is calmer water and more convenient from New Jersey."}]}]
