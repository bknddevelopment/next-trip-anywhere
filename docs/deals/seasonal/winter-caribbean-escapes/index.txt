The sweet spot is booking during Wave Season for the following winter."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I handle the temperature change from NJ winter to Caribbean?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Dress in layers on departure day - wear winter gear to Cape Liberty but pack summer clothes in carry-on.

Your winter coat can stay in your cabin until return."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is the Caribbean hurricane-free in winter?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes!

You might experience occasional trade wind showers, but they're brief and actually refreshing."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are winter cruises less crowded than summer?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Generally yes, except during Presidents Day week and winter breaks.

Perfect for adults seeking peaceful escapes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What if a winter storm hits during my departure from Cape Liberty?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Cruise lines are experienced with winter weather and rarely cancel for snow. Ships can delay departure by a day if needed, and Cape Liberty has excellent snow removal. The port provides updates via text alerts. Travel insurance is recommended for weather delays.

29:["$","$L38",null,{"faqs":[{"id":"faq-0","question":"When is the best time to book a winter Caribbean cruise?","answer":"Wave Season (January through March) offers the year's best cruise deals, with lines competing for bookings. For peak winter dates like Presidents Day, book 3-4 months ahead. Last-minute deals appear 30-60 days before sailing for flexible travelers. The sweet spot is booking during Wave Season for the following winter."},{"id":"faq-1","question":"How do I handle the temperature change from NJ winter to Caribbean?","answer":"Dress in layers on departure day - wear winter gear to Cape Liberty but pack summer clothes in carry-on. Ships gradually warm up as you sail south. Most cruisers shed their winter clothes by day two. Pack a light sweater for aggressive air conditioning onboard. Your winter coat can stay in your cabin until return."},{"id":"faq-2","question":"Is the Caribbean hurricane-free in winter?","answer":"Yes! Hurricane season officially ends November 30th, making December through March the safest weather window. Winter offers the calmest seas, least rainfall, and most consistent sunshine. You might experience occasional trade wind showers, but they're brief and actually refreshing."},{"id":"faq-3","question":"Are winter cruises less crowded than summer?","answer":"Generally yes, except during Presidents Day week and winter breaks. January and early February see the fewest crowds, shorter lines at attractions, and more availability for specialty dining. Ships still offer full entertainment and activities, but with a more relaxed atmosphere. Perfect for adults seeking peaceful escapes."},{"id":"faq-4","question":"What if a winter storm hits during my departure from Cape Liberty?","answer":"Cruise lines are experienced with winter weather and rarely cancel for snow. Ships can delay departure by a day if needed, and Cape Liberty has excellent snow removal. The port provides updates via text alerts. Travel insurance is recommended for weather delays. Most importantly, once you sail, you're heading straight to sunshine!"}]}]
