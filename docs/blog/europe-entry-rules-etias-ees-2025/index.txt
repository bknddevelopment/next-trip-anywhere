The new Entry/Exit System (EES) will affect every Essex County resident flying from Newark Liberty International to any of the 29 European countries in the Schengen Zone. If you're planning European travel this fall, winter, or beyond, you must understand these changes NOW.\n\nFor the 400,000+ Essex County residents who travel to Europe annually—whether for business from Millburn and Short Hills, family visits from Newark's Ironbound district, or leisure travel from Montclair and Maplewood—these new rules represent the biggest change to European travel since the Schengen Agreement. Unlike past updates that affected only certain travelers, EES and the upcoming ETIAS will impact EVERY American visiting Europe.\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [Breaking Down EES vs ETIAS: What's the Difference?](#ees-vs-etias)\n- [EES Launch October 12: What Happens at the Border](#ees-october-12)\n- [ETIAS Coming 2026: The New \"Visa Waiver\" That Isn't](#etias-2026)\n- [Essex County Preparation Checklist](#preparation-checklist)\n- [Newark Airport Departure Changes](#newark-changes)\n- [Country-by-Country Requirements](#country-requirements)\n- [Common Misconceptions Debunked](#misconceptions)\n- [Special Circumstances for Essex County Residents](#special-circumstances)\n- [Timeline and Deadlines](#timeline-deadlines)\n- [Step-by-Step First Trip Guide](#first-trip-guide)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](#faq)\n\n## Breaking Down EES vs ETIAS: What's the Difference? {#ees-vs-etias}\n\n### The Entry/Exit System (EES) - Starts October 12, 2025\n\nThe EES is Europe's new digital border management system that replaces passport stamping with biometric registration. Think of it as Europe's version of the US Visit program that international visitors experience when entering America. Every non-EU citizen, including Americans, will be registered in a central database that tracks entries and exits across all Schengen countries.\n\n**What EES Actually Does:**\n- **Biometric Registration**: Your fingerprints and facial scan are captured on first entry\n- **Digital Tracking**: No more passport stamps—everything is electronic\n- **Automatic Overstay Detection**: The system automatically flags if you exceed 90 days in any 180-day period\n- **Faster Re-entry**: After initial registration, subsequent entries use rapid biometric verification\n- **Enhanced Security**: Real-time checks against security databases\n\n**Key Point for Essex County Travelers**: This is NOT a visa or pre-authorization. EES is a border process that happens when you arrive in Europe, similar to going through customs but with added biometric steps.\n\n### ETIAS Authorization - Coming in 2026\n\nETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorization System) is the pre-travel authorization that will be required BEFORE you board your flight from Newark. Similar to the ESTA that European visitors need for the US, ETIAS is an online application you'll complete days or weeks before travel.\n\n**ETIAS Requirements:**\n- **Online Application**: Complete before booking or at least 96 hours before departure\n- **€7 Fee**: Valid for 3 years or until passport expires\n- **Security Screening**: Background checks against EU databases\n- **Quick Processing**: Most approved within minutes, some may take up to 4 days\n- **Multiple Entries**: Valid for unlimited trips during the validity period\n\n**Critical Distinction**: While EES starts October 12, 2025, ETIAS won't be required until mid-2026. However, understanding both systems now ensures smooth travel planning for the next several years.\n\n## EES Launch October 12: What Happens at the Border {#ees-october-12}\n\n### Your First Entry After October 12\n\nWhen Essex County travelers arrive at their first European destination after October 12, expect significant changes at border control. Here's the exact process:\n\n**Step 1: Separate Queue for Non-EU Citizens**\nUnlike before when lines were often mixed, strict separation between EU and non-EU queues will be enforced. Look for signs reading \"Third Country Nationals\" or \"Non-EU Passports.\"\n\n**Step 2: Self-Service Kiosk (At Major Airports)**\nAirports like Amsterdam Schiphol, Paris CDG, and Frankfurt will have self-service kiosks where you'll:\n- Scan your passport's biometric page\n- Place four fingers on the fingerprint scanner\n- Look into the camera for facial recognition\n- Answer questions about your stay\n\n**Step 3: Border Guard Verification**\nAfter the kiosk, you'll proceed to a border guard who will:\n- Verify your biometric registration\n- Confirm your travel purpose\n- Check you haven't exceeded 90/180 day limits\n- Issue a digital entry record (no stamp!)\n\n**Step 4: Potential Secondary Screening**\nRoughly 5-10% of travelers may be selected for additional screening, including:\n- Verification of return tickets\n- Proof of accommodation\n- Evidence of sufficient funds (€100-120 per day)\n- Travel insurance documentation\n\n### Processing Times: What to Expect\n\n**First Entry (Registration):**\n- Self-service kiosk: 3-5 minutes\n- Border guard review: 2-3 minutes\n- Total time: 5-8 minutes per person\n- Family of four: 20-30 minutes\n\n**Subsequent Entries (Already Registered):**\n- Biometric verification: 30-45 seconds\n- Border guard review: 1-2 minutes\n- Total time: 2-3 minutes per person\n\n**Peak Season Delays:**\nDuring summer 2026, expect first-entry processing to potentially double. Plan for 60-90 minute immigration queues at busy airports during the initial rollout period.\n\n## ETIAS Coming 2026: The New \"Visa Waiver\" That Isn't {#etias-2026}\n\nDespite being called a \"visa waiver,\" ETIAS is actually a travel authorization—a critical distinction for Essex County business travelers who may need actual visas for extended stays or work purposes.\n\n### The ETIAS Application Process\n\n**Required Information:**\n- Passport details (must be valid for 6+ months)\n- Personal information (name, DOB, address)\n- Contact details (email, phone)\n- First EU country of entry\n- Education and employment status\n- Security questions (criminal history, previous deportations)\n- Health declarations (serious communicable diseases)\n\n**For Essex County Residents, Additional Considerations:**\n- **Dual Citizens**: If you hold EU citizenship, you CANNOT apply for ETIAS—use your EU passport\n- **Green Card Holders**: Non-US citizens need ETIAS based on their passport country\n- **Children**: Every traveler needs individual ETIAS, including infants\n- **Multiple Passports**: ETIAS is linked to specific passport—renewal means new application\n\n### ETIAS Approval and Validity\n\n**Instant Approval (95% of Applications):**\nMost Essex County travelers will receive approval within minutes via email. The authorization is electronically linked to your passport—no physical document needed.\n\n**Manual Review (4-96 Hours):**\nApplications flagged for review may require:\n- Additional documentation\n- Consular interview (rare)\n- Extended background checks\n\n**Validity Period:**\n- 3 years from approval OR\n- Until passport expiration (whichever comes first)\n- Unlimited entries during validity\n- Each stay limited to 90 days in 180-day period\n\n## Essex County Preparation Checklist {#preparation-checklist}\n\n### Immediate Actions (Before October 12)\n\n✅ **Passport Verification**\n- Check expiration date (needs 6+ months validity)\n- Ensure machine-readable biometric passport (issued after 2007)\n- Verify passport condition (no significant damage)\n- Count blank pages (minimum 2 required)\n\n✅ **Document Preparation**\n- Scan passport and save to cloud storage\n- Prepare proof of accommodation (hotel bookings, Airbnb confirmations)\n- Document return flights from Newark\n- Gather financial proof (bank statements, credit cards)\n- Compile travel insurance documentation\n\n✅ **Digital Readiness**\n- Ensure smartphone has storage for travel apps\n- Download offline maps for European destinations\n- Save emergency contacts including US embassies\n- Set up international data plan with your Essex County provider\n\n### For October-December 2025 Travelers\n\n**Book Extra Connection Time:**\nIf connecting through European hubs, add minimum 90 minutes for connections during October-November as airports adjust to EES.\n\n**Choose Entry Airports Wisely:**\nSmaller airports may have longer delays initially. Consider:\n- Amsterdam Schiphol (most EES-ready)\n- Munich (efficient processing)\n- Copenhagen (fewer crowds)\n\n**Avoid These During Initial Rollout:**\n- Paris CDG (historically challenging immigration)\n- London Heathrow (non-Schengen plus Schengen connections)\n- Rome Fiumicino (potential for technical issues)\n\n## Newark Airport Departure Changes {#newark-changes}\n\nWhile EES and ETIAS are European systems, Newark Liberty International is preparing travelers for the new requirements:\n\n### United Airlines Hub Preparations\n\nUnited, Newark's largest carrier with 60+ daily European flights, is implementing:\n- **Check-in Verification**: Agents will verify passport validity and (eventually) ETIAS\n- **Gate Announcements**: Reminders about biometric registration\n- **Document Checks**: Enhanced gate screening for European flights\n- **Mobile App Updates**: Integration of ETIAS status checking\n\n### Terminal C International Departures\n\n**Pre-Departure Checklist Zones:**\nNewark is establishing information kiosks in Terminal C where travelers can:\n- Verify passport validity\n- Check Schengen day calculations\n- Access ETIAS application (when launched)\n- Print required documentation\n\n**Recommended Arrival Times from Essex County:**\n- **Off-peak travel**: Arrive 3 hours early (was 2.5)\n- **Peak summer**: Arrive 3.5 hours early\n- **First flight after October 12**: Arrive 4 hours early\n\n## Country-by-Country Requirements {#country-requirements}\n\n### Schengen Countries (EES + ETIAS Required)\nAustria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland\n\n**Special Note for Newark's Popular Routes:**\n- **Italy**: Enhanced scrutiny on tourist visas during peak season\n- **France**: Strictest proof of accommodation requirements\n- **Germany**: Business travelers may need additional documentation\n- **Portugal**: Digital nomad visas available for extended stays\n\n### Non-Schengen European Countries\nThese countries have their own entry requirements, NOT covered by EES/ETIAS:\n\n**United Kingdom**\n- ETA (Electronic Travel Authorization) required as of January 2025\n- £10 fee, valid 2 years\n- Separate from EU systems\n\n**Ireland**\n- No current pre-authorization required\n- May implement system by 2027\n- Common Travel Area with UK\n\n**Balkan Countries** (Albania, Bosnia, Serbia, North Macedonia)\n- Traditional passport stamping continues\n- Various visa policies for Americans\n\n## Common Misconceptions Debunked {#misconceptions}\n\n### Myth 1: \"EES is a Visa Requirement\"\n**Reality**: EES is a border process, not a visa.

Do I need both UK ETA and EES registration?\n**A:** Yes. The UK has its own ETA system (already in effect), while France requires EES registration. You'll do ETA online before travel and EES registration when entering France.\n\n### Q: Can I still get a passport stamp as a souvenir?\n**A:** Some countries may accommodate requests, but stamps are officially obsolete with EES. Consider requesting a stamp on a separate paper if you collect them.\n\n### Q: What if I lose my passport after EES registration?\n**A:** Your biometric data remains in the system for 3 years, but you'll need to re-register with your new passport. The old registration doesn't transfer.\n\n### Q: Do children need fingerprinting for EES?\n**A:** Children under 12 are exempt from fingerprinting but still require facial scanning and registration in the system.\n\n### Q: Will EES know if I overstayed in previous years?\n**A:** EES only tracks entries from October 12, 2025 forward. However, border agents can still check previous stamps and may ask about historical travel.\n\n### Q: Can I use Mobile Passport or Global Entry for European arrival?\n**A:** No, these are US-specific programs. However, some European airports offer paid fast-track services you can purchase.\n\n### Q: What happens if EES systems fail?\n**A:** Airports have contingency plans for manual processing, but expect significant delays. This is why arriving extra early during initial rollout is crucial.\n\n### Q: If I have a flight connection in Europe, do I go through EES twice?\n**A:** No, EES registration happens at your first point of entry to the Schengen Zone. Connections within Schengen don't require additional immigration checks.\n\n### Q: Will cruise ships have EES equipment?\n**A:** Major cruise ports will have EES facilities, but processing may be slower than airports initially. Some cruises may pre-register passengers electronically.\n\n### Q: Can I apply for ETIAS now for 2026 travel?\n**A:** No, the ETIAS system isn't operational yet. Applications will open approximately 6 months before the mandatory date.\n\n## Essential Resources for Essex County Travelers\n\n### Local Travel Agencies with European Expertise\n\n**Next Trip Anywhere** has prepared comprehensive EES/ETIAS support services:\n- Document preparation assistance\n- Visa calculation services\n- ETIAS application support (when launched)\n- European travel insurance plans\n- 24/7 traveler support hotline\n\n### Government Resources\n\n- **US State Department Europe Travel**: travel.state.gov/europe\n- **EU Official EES Information**: europa.eu/ees\n- **ETIAS Official Site**: etias.europa.eu (launches 2026)\n- **Newark Airport International Travel**: newarkairport.com/international\n\n### Mobile Apps to Download\n\n1. **Mobile Passport Control** (for return to US)\n2. **Schengen Calculator** (track your days)\n3. **Re-entry** (90/180 day calculator)\n4. **Your airline's app** (for real-time updates)\n5. **Google Translate** (offline languages)\n\n## The Bottom Line for Essex County Travelers\n\nThe October 12 launch of EES represents a fundamental shift in how Americans enter Europe. While the biometric registration may add time to your first entry, subsequent trips will be faster and more secure. The key to smooth travel is preparation: ensure your passport is current, gather required documentation, and arrive at airports with extra time.\n\nFor Essex County's diverse communities—from business executives flying weekly to Europe, to families visiting relatives, to retirees exploring bucket-list destinations—understanding these new requirements isn't optional. It's essential for continued hassle-free travel to Europe.\n\nThe upcoming ETIAS requirement in 2026 adds another layer, but it's similar to what millions of international visitors already do when visiting the United States. Think of it as Europe catching up to security standards that have been common elsewhere for years.\n\n## Take Action Today\n\nWith just 20 days until EES launches, Essex County travelers must act now:\n\n1. **Check Your Passport Today**: Ensure it's valid for at least 6 months beyond your return date\n2. **Gather Documents**: Start compiling proof of accommodation and financial means\n3. **Calculate Your Days**: If you've been to Europe in 2025, count your Schengen days\n4. **Book Smart**: Add extra connection time for October-December travel\n5. **Stay Informed**: Bookmark official EU sources for updates\n\nRemember, preparation prevents problems. While these new systems may seem daunting, millions of travelers will navigate them successfully. With proper preparation, Essex County residents can continue enjoying everything Europe offers—from Newark's Ironbound community visiting family in Lisbon, to Montclair families exploring Rome, to Short Hills executives closing deals in Frankfurt.\n\nThe golden age of European travel isn't ending—it's evolving. And with the right preparation, your next European adventure can be just as memorable as ever, albeit with a few extra minutes at border control.\n\n---\n\n*Next Trip Anywhere has served Essex County travelers for over 45 years.

The new Entry/Exit System (EES) will affect every Essex County resident flying from Newark Liberty International to any of the 29 European countries in the Schengen Zone. If you're planning European travel this fall, winter, or beyond, you must understand these changes NOW.</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">For the 400,000+ Essex County residents who travel to Europe annually—whether for business from Millburn and Short Hills, family visits from Newark's Ironbound district, or leisure travel from Montclair and Maplewood—these new rules represent the biggest change to European travel since the Schengen Agreement. Unlike past updates that affected only certain travelers, EES and the upcoming ETIAS will impact EVERY American visiting Europe.</p><h2 id="table-of-contents-breaking-down-ees-vs-etias-what-s-the-difference-ees-vs-etias-ees-launch-october-12-what-happens-at-the-border-ees-october-12-etias-coming-2026-the-new-visa-waiver-that-isn-t-etias-2026-essex-county-preparation-checklist-preparation-checklist-newark-airport-departure-changes-newark-changes-country-by-country-requirements-country-requirements-common-misconceptions-debunked-misconceptions-special-circumstances-for-essex-county-residents-special-circumstances-timeline-and-deadlines-timeline-deadlines-step-by-step-first-trip-guide-first-trip-guide-frequently-asked-questions-faq-" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Table of Contents

Think of it as Europe's version of the US Visit program that international visitors experience when entering America. Every non-EU citizen, including Americans, will be registered in a central database that tracks entries and exits across all Schengen countries.</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**What EES Actually Does:**
- **Biometric Registration**: Your fingerprints and facial scan are captured on first entry
- **Digital Tracking**: No more passport stamps—everything is electronic
- **Automatic Overstay Detection**: The system automatically flags if you exceed 90 days in any 180-day period
- **Faster Re-entry**: After initial registration, subsequent entries use rapid biometric verification
- **Enhanced Security**: Real-time checks against security databases</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Key Point for Essex County Travelers**: This is NOT a visa or pre-authorization. EES is a border process that happens when you arrive in Europe, similar to going through customs but with added biometric steps.</p><h3 id="etias-authorization-coming-in-2026" class="text-1xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">ETIAS Authorization - Coming in 2026</h3><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorization System) is the pre-travel authorization that will be required BEFORE you board your flight from Newark. Similar to the ESTA that European visitors need for the US, ETIAS is an online application you'll complete days or weeks before travel.</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**ETIAS Requirements:**
- **Online Application**: Complete before booking or at least 96 hours before departure
- **€7 Fee**: Valid for 3 years or until passport expires
- **Security Screening**: Background checks against EU databases
- **Quick Processing**: Most approved within minutes, some may take up to 4 days
- **Multiple Entries**: Valid for unlimited trips during the validity period</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Critical Distinction**: While EES starts October 12, 2025, ETIAS won't be required until mid-2026. However, understanding both systems now ensures smooth travel planning for the next several years.</p><h2 id="ees-launch-october-12-what-happens-at-the-border-ees-october-12-" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">EES Launch October 12: What Happens at the Border {#ees-october-12}</h2><h3 id="your-first-entry-after-october-12" class="text-1xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Your First Entry After October 12</h3><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">When Essex County travelers arrive at their first European destination after October 12, expect significant changes at border control. Here's the exact process:</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Step 1: Separate Queue for Non-EU Citizens**
Unlike before when lines were often mixed, strict separation between EU and non-EU queues will be enforced. Look for signs reading "Third Country Nationals" or "Non-EU Passports."</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Step 2: Self-Service Kiosk (At Major Airports)**
Airports like Amsterdam Schiphol, Paris CDG, and Frankfurt will have self-service kiosks where you'll:
- Scan your passport's biometric page
- Place four fingers on the fingerprint scanner
- Look into the camera for facial recognition
- Answer questions about your stay</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Step 3: Border Guard Verification**
After the kiosk, you'll proceed to a border guard who will:
- Verify your biometric registration
- Confirm your travel purpose
- Check you haven't exceeded 90/180 day limits
- Issue a digital entry record (no stamp!)</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Step 4: Potential Secondary Screening**
Roughly 5-10% of travelers may be selected for additional screening, including:
- Verification of return tickets
- Proof of accommodation
- Evidence of sufficient funds (€100-120 per day)
- Travel insurance documentation</p><h3 id="processing-times-what-to-expect" class="text-1xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Processing Times: What to Expect</h3><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**First Entry (Registration):**
- Self-service kiosk: 3-5 minutes
- Border guard review: 2-3 minutes
- Total time: 5-8 minutes per person
- Family of four: 20-30 minutes</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Subsequent Entries (Already Registered):**
- Biometric verification: 30-45 seconds
- Border guard review: 1-2 minutes
- Total time: 2-3 minutes per person</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Peak Season Delays:**
During summer 2026, expect first-entry processing to potentially double. Plan for 60-90 minute immigration queues at busy airports during the initial rollout period.</p><h2 id="etias-coming-2026-the-new-visa-waiver-that-isn-t-etias-2026-" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">ETIAS Coming 2026: The New "Visa Waiver" That Isn't {#etias-2026}</h2><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Despite being called a "visa waiver," ETIAS is actually a travel authorization—a critical distinction for Essex County business travelers who may need actual visas for extended stays or work purposes.</p><h3 id="the-etias-application-process" class="text-1xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The ETIAS Application Process</h3><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Required Information:**
- Passport details (must be valid for 6+ months)
- Personal information (name, DOB, address)
- Contact details (email, phone)
- First EU country of entry
- Education and employment status
- Security questions (criminal history, previous deportations)
- Health declarations (serious communicable diseases)</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**For Essex County Residents, Additional Considerations:**
- **Dual Citizens**: If you hold EU citizenship, you CANNOT apply for ETIAS—use your EU passport
- **Green Card Holders**: Non-US citizens need ETIAS based on their passport country
- **Children**: Every traveler needs individual ETIAS, including infants
- **Multiple Passports**: ETIAS is linked to specific passport—renewal means new application</p><h3 id="etias-approval-and-validity" class="text-1xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">ETIAS Approval and Validity</h3><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Instant Approval (95% of Applications):**
Most Essex County travelers will receive approval within minutes via email. The authorization is electronically linked to your passport—no physical document needed.</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Manual Review (4-96 Hours):**
Applications flagged for review may require:
- Additional documentation
- Consular interview (rare)
- Extended background checks</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Validity Period:**
- 3 years from approval OR
- Until passport expiration (whichever comes first)
- Unlimited entries during validity
- Each stay limited to 90 days in 180-day period</p><h2 id="essex-county-preparation-checklist-preparation-checklist-" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Essex County Preparation Checklist {#preparation-checklist}</h2><h3 id="immediate-actions-before-october-12-" class="text-1xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Immediate Actions (Before October 12)</h3><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">✅ **Passport Verification**

If connecting through European hubs, add minimum 90 minutes for connections during October-November as airports adjust to EES.</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Choose Entry Airports Wisely:**
Smaller airports may have longer delays initially. Consider:
- Amsterdam Schiphol (most EES-ready)
- Munich (efficient processing)
- Copenhagen (fewer crowds)</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">**Avoid These During Initial Rollout:**
- Paris CDG (historically challenging immigration)
- London Heathrow (non-Schengen plus Schengen connections)

While the biometric registration may add time to your first entry, subsequent trips will be faster and more secure. The key to smooth travel is preparation: ensure your passport is current, gather required documentation, and arrive at airports with extra time.</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">For Essex County's diverse communities—from business executives flying weekly to Europe, to families visiting relatives, to retirees exploring bucket-list destinations—understanding these new requirements isn't optional. It's essential for continued hassle-free travel to Europe.</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">The upcoming ETIAS requirement in 2026 adds another layer, but it's similar to what millions of international visitors already do when visiting the United States. Think of it as Europe catching up to security standards that have been common elsewhere for years.</p><h2 id="take-action-today" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Take Action Today</h2><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">With just 20 days until EES launches, Essex County travelers must act now:</p><ol class="list-decimal mb-6"><li class="ml-6 mb-2">**Check Your Passport Today**: Ensure it's valid for at least 6 months beyond your return date</li><li class="ml-6 mb-2">**Gather Documents**: Start compiling proof of accommodation and financial means</li><li class="ml-6 mb-2">**Calculate Your Days**: If you've been to Europe in 2025, count your Schengen days</li><li class="ml-6 mb-2">**Book Smart**: Add extra connection time for October-December travel</li><li class="ml-6 mb-2">**Stay Informed**: Bookmark official EU sources for updates</li></ol><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Remember, preparation prevents problems. While these new systems may seem daunting, millions of travelers will navigate them successfully. With proper preparation, Essex County residents can continue enjoying everything Europe offers—from Newark's Ironbound community visiting family in Lisbon, to Montclair families exploring Rome, to Short Hills executives closing deals in Frankfurt.</p><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">The golden age of European travel isn't ending—it's evolving.
