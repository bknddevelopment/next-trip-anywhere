Jamaica provides excellent value with year-round Newark flights, diverse activities, and strong tourist infrastructure. Puerto Rico requires no passport, uses U.S. dollars, and offers varied experiences from beaches to rainforests with familiar American conveniences."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it safe to travel to the Caribbean?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most Caribbean destinations are very safe for tourists who exercise normal precautions. Stay in tourist areas, use hotel-recommended transportation, secure valuables in safes, and avoid displaying wealth. Some islands have higher crime rates in local areas but tourist zones remain well-protected. Research specific island safety before booking. Purchase comprehensive travel insurance including medical evacuation coverage."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need any vaccinations for Caribbean travel?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No vaccinations are required for Caribbean entry from the United States, but CDC recommends being up-to-date on routine vaccines plus Hepatitis A and Typhoid for some travelers. Yellow fever vaccination is only required if arriving from certain African or South American countries. Zika risk has decreased but pregnant women should consult doctors. Use insect repellent to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What documents do Newark residents need for Caribbean travel?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most Caribbean destinations require passports valid for six months beyond travel dates. U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands) only require government-issued ID for citizens. Some islands require return tickets and proof of accommodation. Check specific entry requirements as they change. Cuban travel has special requirements despite improving relations. Always make copies of documents stored separately from originals."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"When is hurricane season and should I avoid Caribbean travel then?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Hurricane season runs June 1 through November 30, peaking August through October. However, storms rarely affect specific islands, and modern forecasting provides warning. Southern Caribbean islands (Aruba, Barbados, Trinidad) sit outside the hurricane belt. Travel insurance protects your investment. Many Newark travelers find excellent value during this period with proper precautions. Avoid September-October for lowest risk."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much should I budget for a Caribbean vacation from Newark?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Budget depends dramatically on choices. All-inclusive packages from Newark start around $1,500 per person for a week including flights. Luxury resorts can exceed $5,000 per person. Daily spending money needs: $50-100 at all-inclusives for extras, $150-250 at regular hotels including meals. Excursions add $75-200 per person per activity. Factor in airport parking ($25/day at Newark) or transportation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I exchange money before leaving Newark?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"U.S. dollars are accepted everywhere in the Caribbean, though you may receive change in local currency. ATMs provide better exchange rates than airport kiosks. Bring some small bills for immediate needs like taxi tips. Notify your bank of travel plans. Consider getting some Eastern Caribbean dollars if visiting multiple Eastern islands, but dollars work fine everywhere."}}]}]}1a:[["$","$L23",null,{"id":"guide-schema","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$24"}}],false,"$L25"]

Jamaica provides excellent value with year-round Newark flights, diverse activities, and strong tourist infrastructure. Puerto Rico requires no passport, uses U.S. dollars, and offers varied experiences from beaches to rainforests with familiar American conveniences."},{"question":"Is it safe to travel to the Caribbean?","answer":"Most Caribbean destinations are very safe for tourists who exercise normal precautions. Stay in tourist areas, use hotel-recommended transportation, secure valuables in safes, and avoid displaying wealth. Some islands have higher crime rates in local areas but tourist zones remain well-protected. Research specific island safety before booking. Purchase comprehensive travel insurance including medical evacuation coverage."},{"question":"Do I need any vaccinations for Caribbean travel?","answer":"No vaccinations are required for Caribbean entry from the United States, but CDC recommends being up-to-date on routine vaccines plus Hepatitis A and Typhoid for some travelers. Yellow fever vaccination is only required if arriving from certain African or South American countries. Zika risk has decreased but pregnant women should consult doctors. Use insect repellent to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses."},{"question":"What documents do Newark residents need for Caribbean travel?","answer":"Most Caribbean destinations require passports valid for six months beyond travel dates. U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands) only require government-issued ID for citizens. Some islands require return tickets and proof of accommodation. Check specific entry requirements as they change. Cuban travel has special requirements despite improving relations. Always make copies of documents stored separately from originals."},{"question":"When is hurricane season and should I avoid Caribbean travel then?","answer":"Hurricane season runs June 1 through November 30, peaking August through October. However, storms rarely affect specific islands, and modern forecasting provides warning. Southern Caribbean islands (Aruba, Barbados, Trinidad) sit outside the hurricane belt. Travel insurance protects your investment. Many Newark travelers find excellent value during this period with proper precautions. Avoid September-October for lowest risk."},{"question":"How much should I budget for a Caribbean vacation from Newark?","answer":"Budget depends dramatically on choices. All-inclusive packages from Newark start around $1,500 per person for a week including flights. Luxury resorts can exceed $5,000 per person. Daily spending money needs: $50-100 at all-inclusives for extras, $150-250 at regular hotels including meals. Excursions add $75-200 per person per activity. Factor in airport parking ($25/day at Newark) or transportation."},{"question":"Should I exchange money before leaving Newark?","answer":"U.S. dollars are accepted everywhere in the Caribbean, though you may receive change in local currency. ATMs provide better exchange rates than airport kiosks. Bring some small bills for immediate needs like taxi tips. Notify your bank of travel plans. Consider getting some Eastern Caribbean dollars if visiting multiple Eastern islands, but dollars work fine everywhere."}]}]]}]}]}]}]}]
