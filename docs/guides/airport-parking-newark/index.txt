Daily Parking P4 runs $60/day walk-up or $38/day pre-booked. Economy Lot P6 charges $35/day walk-up or $30/day reserved. Off-site lots start at $6-12/day. Rates increase during peak periods and holidays. Book online 24+ hours ahead for significant savings at official lots."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which Newark Airport parking option is best for week-long trips?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Economy Lot P6 or off-site parking provides best value for 7+ day trips. P6 costs $30/day pre-booked with shuttle service. Off-site lots offer $6-12/day with similar shuttle convenience. Park-and-fly hotel packages work well for 7-10 day trips, essentially providing free parking with one night's stay. Avoid terminal parking for extended trips unless corporate travel policies require it."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How early should I arrive for Newark Airport parking?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Arrive 30 minutes earlier than normal check-in recommendations to account for parking and potential shuttle time. For economy lots, add 45 minutes during peak travel periods. Terminal parking requires less buffer time but fills quickly during morning rush. Off-site lots need 45-60 minutes extra for shuttle transportation. Holiday travel demands arriving 60+ minutes earlier than typical recommendations."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are there free parking options at Newark Airport?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Cell Phone Lots offer free short-term parking for passenger pickups only. NJ Transit stations provide free or cheap parking with train connections to the airport. Some hotels offer free park-and-fly packages with room bookings. No free long-term parking exists at Newark Airport itself. Consider having someone drop you off and pick you up to avoid parking entirely."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is off-site Newark Airport parking safe?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Reputable off-site lots provide security comparable to official airport parking with 24/7 surveillance, fencing, and regular patrols. Research reviews before booking, focusing on security incidents and insurance coverage. Established providers like The Parking Spot, Vista Parking, and Newark Long Term Parking maintain strong security records. Avoid unmarked lots or deals seeming too good to be true."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I pay for Newark Airport parking with cash?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, Newark Airport's official lots don't accept cash - only credit/debit cards, E-ZPass Plus, and contactless payments. Most off-site lots accept cash but prefer card payments. Bring multiple payment methods as backup. E-ZPass Plus provides fastest exit but ensure sufficient credit limit for extended stays. Some lots accept mobile payments through apps."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens if my Newark Airport parking reservation lot is full?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Confirmed online reservations guarantee spaces at official Newark Airport lots - they don't oversell. Off-site lots occasionally oversell but must accommodate you at comparable facilities. Always bring confirmation emails.

Daily Parking P4 runs $60/day walk-up or $38/day pre-booked. Economy Lot P6 charges $35/day walk-up or $30/day reserved. Off-site lots start at $6-12/day. Rates increase during peak periods and holidays. Book online 24+ hours ahead for significant savings at official lots."},{"question":"Which Newark Airport parking option is best for week-long trips?","answer":"Economy Lot P6 or off-site parking provides best value for 7+ day trips. P6 costs $30/day pre-booked with shuttle service. Off-site lots offer $6-12/day with similar shuttle convenience. Park-and-fly hotel packages work well for 7-10 day trips, essentially providing free parking with one night's stay. Avoid terminal parking for extended trips unless corporate travel policies require it."},{"question":"How early should I arrive for Newark Airport parking?","answer":"Arrive 30 minutes earlier than normal check-in recommendations to account for parking and potential shuttle time. For economy lots, add 45 minutes during peak travel periods. Terminal parking requires less buffer time but fills quickly during morning rush. Off-site lots need 45-60 minutes extra for shuttle transportation. Holiday travel demands arriving 60+ minutes earlier than typical recommendations."},{"question":"Are there free parking options at Newark Airport?","answer":"Cell Phone Lots offer free short-term parking for passenger pickups only. NJ Transit stations provide free or cheap parking with train connections to the airport. Some hotels offer free park-and-fly packages with room bookings. No free long-term parking exists at Newark Airport itself. Consider having someone drop you off and pick you up to avoid parking entirely."},{"question":"Is off-site Newark Airport parking safe?","answer":"Reputable off-site lots provide security comparable to official airport parking with 24/7 surveillance, fencing, and regular patrols. Research reviews before booking, focusing on security incidents and insurance coverage. Established providers like The Parking Spot, Vista Parking, and Newark Long Term Parking maintain strong security records. Avoid unmarked lots or deals seeming too good to be true."},{"question":"Can I pay for Newark Airport parking with cash?","answer":"No, Newark Airport's official lots don't accept cash - only credit/debit cards, E-ZPass Plus, and contactless payments. Most off-site lots accept cash but prefer card payments. Bring multiple payment methods as backup. E-ZPass Plus provides fastest exit but ensure sufficient credit limit for extended stays. Some lots accept mobile payments through apps."},{"question":"What happens if my Newark Airport parking reservation lot is full?","answer":"Confirmed online reservations guarantee spaces at official Newark Airport lots - they don't oversell. Off-site lots occasionally oversell but must accommodate you at comparable facilities. Always bring confirmation emails. If denied, their contracts typically require providing alternative parking at equal or lower rates. Arrive early during peak periods as \"guaranteed\" sometimes means shuttling to overflow lots."}]}]]}]}]}]}]}]
