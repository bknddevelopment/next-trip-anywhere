Power strips without surge protection are allowed. Check your specific cruise line website for their complete prohibited items list, as policies vary slightly between companies."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much luggage can I bring on a cruise from Cape Liberty?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most cruise lines don't have strict luggage limits, but be practical about cabin storage space. Typical recommendation is one large suitcase and one carry-on per person. If flying to meet your cruise, airline baggage limits apply. For Cape Liberty departures where you're driving or taking ground transportation from Newark, you have more flexibility. Remember porters appreciate tips of $2-3 per bag."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should Newark residents pack differently for Caribbean cruises?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes! New Jersey residents need extra sun protection since we're not acclimated to intense tropical sun. Pack higher SPF sunscreen, sun hats, and UV-protective clothing. Bring layers for aggressive ship air conditioning that can shock those used to moderate indoor temperatures. Include seasickness remedies as the Atlantic leaving New York harbor can be rougher than southern departure ports."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What should I pack in my carry-on for embarkation day?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Pack essential medications, travel documents, valuables, swimsuit, sunscreen, change of clothes, and anything you need before luggage arrives at your cabin (usually 2-4 hours after boarding). Include phone charger, reading materials, and any items needed for planned day-one activities. Newark travelers should include a light jacket for the typically cool morning departure from Cape Liberty."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to bring towels on a cruise?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Cruise ships provide pool and bathroom towels, so you don't need to pack these. However, bring a lightweight microfiber beach towel for shore excursions. Ship towels aren't allowed off the vessel, and beach towel rentals at ports are expensive. Quick-dry travel towels take minimal luggage space and prove invaluable for beach days."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How should I pack medications for a cruise?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bring all medications in original prescription bottles with pharmacy labels. Pack enough for your entire trip plus extra in case of delays. Divide medications between carry-on and checked luggage. Include a written list of all medications with generic names. For controlled substances, carry a doctor's note. Newark residents can use major chain pharmacies that operate nationwide for emergency refills if needed."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What special items do experienced cruisers always pack?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Veteran cruisers never sail without magnetic hooks, highlighters for daily programs, lanyards for key cards, over-the-door organizers, power strips without surge protectors, pop-up hampers, binoculars for scenic viewing, downloaded entertainment for sea days, reef-safe sunscreen, and small bills for tipping. These items significantly improve the cruise experience and solve common onboard inconveniences."}}]}]}1a:[["$","$L23",null,{"id":"guide-schema","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$24"}}],false,"$L25"]

For shore excursions, pack quick-dry clothing and avoid cotton that stays wet. Don't forget a light jacket or cardigan - ship air conditioning can be aggressive, and evening deck winds get chilly. Footwear should include comfortable walking shoes for ship and shore, flip-flops for pool areas, dress shoes for formal nights, and water shoes for beach excursions. Newark residents often forget reef-safe water shoes - essential for Caribbean beaches with coral or rocks."}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"my-8 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-teal-50 rounded-lg p-6 border-l-4 border-blue-600","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-start","children":[["$","svg",null,{"ref":"$undefined","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","width":24,"height":24,"viewBox":"0 0 24 24","fill":"none","stroke":"currentColor","strokeWidth":2,"strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","className":"lucide lucide-shield w-8 h-8 text-blue-600 mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1","aria-hidden":"true","children":[["$","path","oel41y",{"d":"M20 13c0 5-3.5 7.5-7.66 8.95a1 1 0 0 1-.67-.01C7.5 20.5 4 18 4 13V6a1 1 0 0 1 1-1c2 0 4.5-1.2 6.24-2.72a1.17 1.17 0 0 1 1.52 0C14.51 3.81 17 5 19 5a1 1 0 0 1 1 1z"}],"$undefined"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-1","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2","children":"Need Expert Guidance?"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-700 mb-4","children":"Our Essex County travel experts are ready to help you navigate your travel planning."}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-4","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"tel:833-874-1019","className":"inline-flex items-center px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white font-bold rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors","children":[["$","svg",null,{"ref":"$undefined","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","width":24,"height":24,"viewBox":"0 0 24 24","fill":"none","stroke":"currentColor","strokeWidth":2,"strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","className":"lucide lucide-phone w-5 h-5 mr-2","aria-hidden":"true","children":[["$","path","9njp5v",{"d":"M13.832 16.568a1 1 0 0 0 1.213-.303l.355-.465A2 2 0 0 1 17 15h3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v3a2 2 0 0 1-2 2A18 18 0 0 1 2 4a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v3a2 2 0 0 1-.8 1.6l-.468.351a1 1 0 0 0-.292 1.233 14 14 0 0 0 6.392 6.384"}],"$undefined"]}],"Call 833-874-1019"]}],false]}]]}]]}]}],false]}]

Power strips without surge protection are allowed. Check your specific cruise line website for their complete prohibited items list, as policies vary slightly between companies."},{"question":"How much luggage can I bring on a cruise from Cape Liberty?","answer":"Most cruise lines don't have strict luggage limits, but be practical about cabin storage space. Typical recommendation is one large suitcase and one carry-on per person. If flying to meet your cruise, airline baggage limits apply. For Cape Liberty departures where you're driving or taking ground transportation from Newark, you have more flexibility. Remember porters appreciate tips of $2-3 per bag."},{"question":"Should Newark residents pack differently for Caribbean cruises?","answer":"Yes! New Jersey residents need extra sun protection since we're not acclimated to intense tropical sun. Pack higher SPF sunscreen, sun hats, and UV-protective clothing. Bring layers for aggressive ship air conditioning that can shock those used to moderate indoor temperatures. Include seasickness remedies as the Atlantic leaving New York harbor can be rougher than southern departure ports."},{"question":"What should I pack in my carry-on for embarkation day?","answer":"Pack essential medications, travel documents, valuables, swimsuit, sunscreen, change of clothes, and anything you need before luggage arrives at your cabin (usually 2-4 hours after boarding). Include phone charger, reading materials, and any items needed for planned day-one activities. Newark travelers should include a light jacket for the typically cool morning departure from Cape Liberty."},{"question":"Do I need to bring towels on a cruise?","answer":"Cruise ships provide pool and bathroom towels, so you don't need to pack these. However, bring a lightweight microfiber beach towel for shore excursions. Ship towels aren't allowed off the vessel, and beach towel rentals at ports are expensive. Quick-dry travel towels take minimal luggage space and prove invaluable for beach days."},{"question":"How should I pack medications for a cruise?","answer":"Bring all medications in original prescription bottles with pharmacy labels. Pack enough for your entire trip plus extra in case of delays. Divide medications between carry-on and checked luggage. Include a written list of all medications with generic names. For controlled substances, carry a doctor's note. Newark residents can use major chain pharmacies that operate nationwide for emergency refills if needed."},{"question":"What special items do experienced cruisers always pack?","answer":"Veteran cruisers never sail without magnetic hooks, highlighters for daily programs, lanyards for key cards, over-the-door organizers, power strips without surge protectors, pop-up hampers, binoculars for scenic viewing, downloaded entertainment for sea days, reef-safe sunscreen, and small bills for tipping. These items significantly improve the cruise experience and solve common onboard inconveniences."}]}]]}]}]}]}]}]
