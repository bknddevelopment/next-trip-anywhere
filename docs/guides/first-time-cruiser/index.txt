Ships are massive and remarkably stable. If concerned, choose a larger ship, book a midship cabin on a lower deck, and bring preventive medication like Dramamine or Bonine. Start taking it before sailing. Natural remedies include ginger, acupressure bands, and staying hydrated. Fresh air on deck helps if you feel queasy. Avoid reading in your cabin and limit alcohol consumption the first day."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much money should I budget beyond the cruise fare?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Budget $100-150 per person per day for onboard expenses including gratuities ($15-20 daily), beverages ($10-15 per drink), specialty dining ($20-50 per meal), and miscellaneous purchases. Shore excursions average $75-150 per person per port. Spa services, photos, and internet are additional. Newark residents can save by purchasing beverage packages if drinking more than 5-6 drinks daily. Set up onboard spending alerts to track expenses."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens if I miss the ship in port?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Ships wait only for their own sponsored excursions. If you're late from an independent tour, you're responsible for reaching the next port at your expense. This is why first-timers should book some excursions through the cruise line. Always return to ship 60 minutes before all-aboard time. Keep ship's phone number and port agent contact information with you. Travel insurance may cover costs if you miss the ship due to covered reasons."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is Cape Liberty a good port for first-time cruisers from Newark?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Cape Liberty is ideal for Newark-area first-time cruisers. Located just 20-30 minutes away in Bayonne, it eliminates flight stress and costs. You can arrive relaxed without worrying about flight delays or lost luggage. Parking is available on-site, or use hotel park-and-cruise packages. The port is less crowded than Miami or Fort Lauderdale. However, the first night can be rough sailing through New York Harbor into the Atlantic."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need a passport for a cruise from Cape Liberty?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Technically, closed-loop cruises (returning to the same U.S. port) only require a birth certificate and government-issued photo ID. However, we strongly recommend passports for all cruise travel. If you have a medical emergency and need to fly home from a foreign port, you need a passport. Some islands require passports for entry. Passport cards work for sea travel but not emergency flights home. Full passport books provide maximum flexibility."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"When should I book my first cruise for the best deal?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"'Wave Season' (January-March) offers the best promotions for cruises year-round. Black Friday through Cyber Monday also features excellent deals. Book 6-12 months in advance for best cabin selection and prices. Last-minute deals exist but limit options. Newark residents should avoid booking Caribbean cruises for September-October peak hurricane season unless comfortable with potential itinerary changes. Repositioning cruises offer incredible value but require one-way flights."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What should first-time cruisers avoid doing?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Don't overpack - cabins are small. Don't skip travel insurance - medical evacuation is expensive. Don't book flights arriving the same day as your cruise. Don't ignore the muster drill - it's mandatory. Don't reserve every night for specialty restaurants - main dining rooms are excellent and included. Don't feel obligated to do everything - it's your vacation. Don't forget to budget for gratuities and extras. Don't bring prohibited items like surge protectors or candles."}}]}]}1a:[["$","$L23",null,{"id":"guide-schema","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$24"}}],false,"$L25"]

Ships are massive and remarkably stable. If concerned, choose a larger ship, book a midship cabin on a lower deck, and bring preventive medication like Dramamine or Bonine. Start taking it before sailing. Natural remedies include ginger, acupressure bands, and staying hydrated. Fresh air on deck helps if you feel queasy. Avoid reading in your cabin and limit alcohol consumption the first day."},{"question":"How much money should I budget beyond the cruise fare?","answer":"Budget $100-150 per person per day for onboard expenses including gratuities ($15-20 daily), beverages ($10-15 per drink), specialty dining ($20-50 per meal), and miscellaneous purchases. Shore excursions average $75-150 per person per port. Spa services, photos, and internet are additional. Newark residents can save by purchasing beverage packages if drinking more than 5-6 drinks daily. Set up onboard spending alerts to track expenses."},{"question":"What happens if I miss the ship in port?","answer":"Ships wait only for their own sponsored excursions. If you're late from an independent tour, you're responsible for reaching the next port at your expense. This is why first-timers should book some excursions through the cruise line. Always return to ship 60 minutes before all-aboard time. Keep ship's phone number and port agent contact information with you. Travel insurance may cover costs if you miss the ship due to covered reasons."},{"question":"Is Cape Liberty a good port for first-time cruisers from Newark?","answer":"Cape Liberty is ideal for Newark-area first-time cruisers. Located just 20-30 minutes away in Bayonne, it eliminates flight stress and costs. You can arrive relaxed without worrying about flight delays or lost luggage. Parking is available on-site, or use hotel park-and-cruise packages. The port is less crowded than Miami or Fort Lauderdale. However, the first night can be rough sailing through New York Harbor into the Atlantic."},{"question":"Do I need a passport for a cruise from Cape Liberty?","answer":"Technically, closed-loop cruises (returning to the same U.S. port) only require a birth certificate and government-issued photo ID. However, we strongly recommend passports for all cruise travel. If you have a medical emergency and need to fly home from a foreign port, you need a passport. Some islands require passports for entry. Passport cards work for sea travel but not emergency flights home. Full passport books provide maximum flexibility."},{"question":"When should I book my first cruise for the best deal?","answer":"'Wave Season' (January-March) offers the best promotions for cruises year-round. Black Friday through Cyber Monday also features excellent deals. Book 6-12 months in advance for best cabin selection and prices. Last-minute deals exist but limit options. Newark residents should avoid booking Caribbean cruises for September-October peak hurricane season unless comfortable with potential itinerary changes. Repositioning cruises offer incredible value but require one-way flights."},{"question":"What should first-time cruisers avoid doing?","answer":"Don't overpack - cabins are small. Don't skip travel insurance - medical evacuation is expensive. Don't book flights arriving the same day as your cruise. Don't ignore the muster drill - it's mandatory. Don't reserve every night for specialty restaurants - main dining rooms are excellent and included. Don't feel obligated to do everything - it's your vacation. Don't forget to budget for gratuities and extras. Don't bring prohibited items like surge protectors or candles."}]}]]}]}]}]}]}]
