## [2025-09-01] - Component Architecture

### Context

Current components are monolithic, not reusable, and lack consistent patterns.

### Decision

Adopt Atomic Design methodology with the following structure:

```
components/
├── atoms/       # Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Label)
├── molecules/   # Simple combinations (FormField, Card)
├── organisms/   # Complex components (Header, SearchForm)
├── templates/   # Page layouts
└── pages/       # Full page components
```

### Rationale

- Atomic Design provides clear hierarchy
- Promotes reusability and consistency
- Makes testing easier (test atoms in isolation)
- Improves maintainability

### Alternatives Considered

- **Feature-based structure:** Less clear component hierarchy
- **MVC pattern:** Not ideal for React components
- **No specific pattern:** Led to current problems

### Consequences

- Positive: Better organization, reusability, testability
- Negative: Initial refactoring effort, learning curve
- Technical debt: Need to gradually migrate existing components

## [2025-09-01] - State Management Strategy

### Context

Currently no centralized state management, leading to prop drilling and duplicated state.

### Decision

Implement a hybrid approach:

- **Zustand:** Global app state (user preferences, app config)
- **React Query:** Server state (API data, cache)
- **React Context:** Feature-specific state (forms, modals)
- **Local State:** Component-specific UI state

### Rationale

- Separation of concerns between server and client state
- Zustand is simple and performant for global state
- React Query excels at server state management
- Context is perfect for feature isolation

### Alternatives Considered

- **All Zustand:** Would need to build caching logic
- **All Context:** Performance issues with frequent updates
- **Redux Toolkit:** Overkill for current needs

### Consequences

- Positive: Clear state boundaries, optimal performance, good DX
