## Project Overview

### Current State Analysis

The Next Trip Anywhere website is currently:

- ✅ **Working**: Deployed successfully to GitHub Pages
- ✅ **Styled**: CSS and assets loading correctly
- ⚠️ **Technical Debt**: Monolithic components, no tests, performance issues

- ❌ **Testing**: No test coverage
- ❌ **Documentation**: Minimal documentation beyond deployment guides

### Rebuild Goals

- 🎯 **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, consistent patterns
- 🎯 **Performance**: < 2.5s LCP, < 100KB initial bundle
- 🎯 **Testing**: 80% unit test coverage, E2E for critical paths
- 🎯 **Maintainability**: Atomic design, clear documentation
- 🎯 **User Experience**: Better loading states, error handling
- 🎯 **Developer Experience**: Fast builds, hot reload, good tooling

## Session Logs

### 2025-09-01 - Initial Planning Session

#### Session Summary

**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Focus:** Project setup and documentation  
**Outcome:** Comprehensive rebuild plan established

#### Work Completed

1. **Project Analysis**
   - Reviewed existing codebase structure
   - Identified Next.js 15 with App Router setup
   - Noted GitHub Pages deployment configuration
   - Found no existing tests or documentation

2. **Documentation Created**
   - TODO.md: 6-phase rebuild plan with detailed tasks
   - DECISIONS.md: 12+ architectural decisions documented
   - PROGRESS.md: Progress tracking system established

3. **Planning Outcomes**
   - Clear 4-week timeline established
   - Technology stack decided (Next.js, TypeScript, Zustand, React Query)
   - Testing strategy defined (Unit, Integration, E2E)
   - Performance targets set (Core Web Vitals)

#### Key Discoveries

- Project uses Next.js 15 with static export for GitHub Pages
- Custom path fixing script handles GitHub Pages subdirectory
- No existing tests or proper TypeScript configuration
- Components are monolithic and not reusable
- No state management or data fetching patterns

#### Next Session Priorities

1. Complete remaining documentation (checklist, dependencies)
2. Begin Phase 1: Foundation setup
3. Create project structure
4. Set up TypeScript strict mode

## Risk Register

### High Priority Risks

1. **GitHub Pages Compatibility**
   - Risk: Changes might break GitHub Pages deployment
   - Mitigation: Test deployment after each phase
2. **Breaking Existing Features**
   - Risk: Refactoring might break working features
   - Mitigation: Incremental changes with testing

3. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Risk: 4-week timeline might be aggressive
   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical features, defer nice-to-haves

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Performance Regression**
   - Risk: New features might slow down site
   - Mitigation: Performance budget and monitoring

2. **Complex Migration**
   - Risk: Component refactoring might be complex
   - Mitigation: Gradual migration with compatibility layer

### Low Priority Risks

1. **Tool Learning Curve**
   - Risk: New tools might slow development
   - Mitigation: Good documentation and examples

---

## Blockers & Issues

### Current Blockers

- None at this phase

### Resolved Issues

- None yet

### Questions to Address

1. Should we maintain backward compatibility during rebuild?
2. How to handle API mocking for GitHub Pages?
3. What level of browser support is required?
4. Should we implement internationalization now or later?
