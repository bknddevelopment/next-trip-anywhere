## Schema Update Preview

**Current Schema (No GBP):**

```typescript
address: {
  '@type': 'PostalAddress',
  addressCountry: 'US',
  addressRegion: 'Nationwide Service', // Too vague
}
// No aggregateRating (removed fake reviews ✅)
```

**After GBP Setup (Service Area Model):**

```typescript
address: {
  '@type': 'PostalAddress',
  addressCountry: 'US',
}
areaServed: [
  { '@type': 'State', name: 'New Jersey' },
  { '@type': 'State', name: 'New York' },
  { '@type': 'State', name: 'Pennsylvania' },
  { '@type': 'State', name: 'Connecticut' },
]
sameAs: [
  'https://g.page/nexttripanywhere', // ← Your GBP URL
  'https://www.facebook.com/nexttripanywhere',
  // ... other social links
]
// After collecting 10+ real reviews:
aggregateRating: {
  '@type': 'AggregateRating',
  ratingValue: '4.8',  // ← Real GBP rating
  reviewCount: '27',   // ← Real GBP count
  bestRating: '5',
  worstRating: '1',
}
```

## Review Collection Strategy

### Phase 1: Seed Reviews (First 10 reviews, Week 1-2)

**Target:** Past customers who had great experiences

**Outreach:**

```
Email Template:
Subject: How was your [Destination] trip?

Hi [Name],

We hope you had an amazing time in [destination]!

Would you mind sharing your experience on Google? It only takes 60 seconds
and helps other travelers find us.

[Leave a Review Button]

As a thank you, we'll send you exclusive deals for your next adventure!

Best,
[Your Name]
Next Trip Anywhere
```

**Follow-Up:**

- Call satisfied customers 1-2 weeks after return
- Mention review in casual conversation
- Send review link via text if interested

---

### Phase 2: Ongoing Collection (Reviews 11-25, Month 1-2)

**Automation:**

- Add review request to post-trip email sequence
- Include QR code in email signature
- Post on social media monthly: "Love us? Leave a review!"

**Incentive (FTC Compliant):**

```
"Leave us any honest review and get $10 off your next booking!"
```

(Must allow negative reviews too - can't incentivize only positive)

---

### Phase 3: Sustained Growth (25+ reviews, Month 3+)

**Best Practices:**

- Respond to ALL reviews within 24 hours
- Thank reviewers by name
- Address concerns in negative reviews professionally
- Showcase reviews on website/social media
- Aim for 2-4 new reviews per month
