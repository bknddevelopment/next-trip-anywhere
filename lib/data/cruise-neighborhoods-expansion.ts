        question: 'Do Central Park balconies get any natural light?',
        answer:
          'Yes! Central Park balconies receive 2-4 hours of direct sunlight daily (typically 11am-3pm) depending on deck and season. Deck 10 receives the most sun, while deck 8 gets the least. The filtered light through the open atrium top is pleasant throughout the day, and the park is beautifully lit at night.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you smell the restaurants from Central Park cabins?',
        answer:
          'Some cabins, especially those directly above kitchens, may notice pleasant food aromas during meal times. Most guests find the smells appetizing rather than bothersome. To minimize this, avoid cabins ending in 18-22 which are typically above restaurant kitchens.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is Central Park quiet enough for sleeping?',
        answer:
          'Central Park is the quietest neighborhood on Symphony of the Seas. Restaurants close by 10-11pm, and the park itself acts as a sound buffer. With no ocean waves or wind noise, most guests report better sleep than ocean-facing cabins. Light sleepers should choose deck 10 or forward/aft cabins away from Trellis Bar.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Are Central Park cabins good for kids?',
        answer:
          "Yes! Families love Central Park for the central location (shorter walks to activities), quiet for nap times, and Park Cafe's quick complimentary meals. The garden atmosphere is magical for children, and you're steps from restaurants with kids menus.",
      },
      {
        question: 'How do Central Park cabins compare in price to ocean balconies?',
        answer:
          'Central Park balconies typically cost $250-450 more per cabin than standard ocean-view balconies on Symphony. However, the unique experience, quietness, weather protection, and restaurant proximity make them worth the premium for couples and families valuing these features.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you see the ocean at all from Central Park?',
        answer:
          'No, Central Park balconies face inward to the garden atrium. For ocean views, visit the pool decks (15-16), Boardwalk (deck 6), or upper observation decks (14-15). Many guests appreciate having a quiet retreat (Central Park cabin) while enjoying ocean views from public areas.',

        question: "What's the best Central Park cabin for Essex County cruisers?",
