## Step 1: Get Your Verification Code (2 minutes)

### Option A: Already Have a Google Search Console Account

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Click **"Add Property"**
3. Select **"URL prefix"** (recommended)
4. Enter: `https://nexttripanywhere.com`
5. Click **"Continue"**
6. Choose **"HTML tag"** method
7. Copy the code from the meta tag:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_CODE_HERE" />
   ```
8. You only need the `content` value (e.g., `uW2M7x3...`)

### Option B: New to Google Search Console

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Sign in with your Google account (or create one)
3. Click **"Start now"**
4. Click **"Add a property"**
5. Select **"URL prefix"**
6. Enter: `https://nexttripanywhere.com`
7. Click **"Continue"**
8. Under verification methods, select **"HTML tag"**
9. Copy the verification code from:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="uW2M7x3aBc..." />
   ```
10. Keep this tab open!

---

## Step 2: Add Your Verification Code to the Website

### Find Your Code

Look for a meta tag like this:

```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="uW2M7x3aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ" />
```

**Copy only the content value:** `uW2M7x3aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ`

### Update the Code

I've prepared a file where you need to paste your code:

**File:** `app/layout.tsx` (line 141)

**Current (placeholder):**

```typescript
verification: {
  google: 'your-google-verification-code',  // ← REPLACE THIS
```

**Change to (your actual code):**

```typescript
verification: {
  google: 'uW2M7x3aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ',  // ← YOUR ACTUAL CODE
```

---

## Step 3: Build and Deploy

After adding your code:

```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# Push to GitHub (triggers auto-deploy)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add Google Search Console verification"
git push origin main
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy.

---

## Step 4: Verify Ownership

1. Go back to Google Search Console tab
2. Click **"Verify"** button
3. You should see: ✅ **"Ownership verified"**

If verification fails:

- Wait 5 minutes (DNS/cache propagation)
- Try again
- Check that the code was deployed to nexttripanywhere.com

---

## Step 5: Submit Your Sitemap (Immediate Action)

Once verified:

1. In Google Search Console, go to **"Sitemaps"** (left menu)
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click **"Submit"**
4. Status should show: **"Success"** (may take a few hours)

Your sitemap contains **595 URLs** and will be automatically crawled.

---

## Step 6: Enable All Reports

In Google Search Console, enable these features:

### Performance Report

- Shows clicks, impressions, CTR, average position
- **Action:** No setup needed (auto-enabled)

### Coverage Report

- Shows which pages are indexed
- **Action:** No setup needed (auto-enabled)

### Core Web Vitals

- Shows LCP, INP, CLS scores
- **Action:** No setup needed (auto-enabled after 28 days of data)

### Mobile Usability

- **Action:** No setup needed (auto-enabled)

---

## What You'll See After Setup

### 2-7 Days

## Other Verification Codes to Add

While you're at it, consider adding these (optional):

### Bing Webmaster Tools

1. Go to: https://www.bing.com/webmasters
2. Get verification code
3. Add to `app/layout.tsx` line 145:
   ```typescript
   'msvalidate.01': 'YOUR_BING_CODE',
   ```

### Yandex Webmaster (International SEO)

1. Go to: https://webmaster.yandex.com
2. Get verification code
3. Add to `app/layout.tsx` line 142:
   ```typescript
   yandex: 'YOUR_YANDEX_CODE',
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Verification failed"

- **Cause:** Code not deployed yet
- **Fix:** Wait 5 minutes, clear browser cache, try again

### "Meta tag not found"

- **Cause:** Code in wrong location
- **Fix:** Ensure code is in `app/layout.tsx` line 141

### "Sitemap not found"

- **Cause:** Using wrong sitemap URL
- **Fix:** Use `sitemap.xml` (not `/sitemap.xml`)

### "No data in reports"

- **Cause:** Not enough time has passed
- **Fix:** Wait 48-72 hours for first data

---

## Important Notes

1. **Don't remove the verification code** - It needs to stay in the site permanently
2. **Multiple properties** - You can add both `nexttripanywhere.com` and `www.nexttripanywhere.com` (if applicable)
3. **Analytics connection** - After setup, connect to Google Analytics for combined reports
4. **User permissions** - Add team members in Settings → Users & Permissions

---

- **Index Coverage:** Know which of your 595 pages are indexed
- **Core Web Vitals:** Monitor LCP, INP, CLS scores
- **Mobile Usability:** Identify mobile issues

---

## Next Steps After Verification
